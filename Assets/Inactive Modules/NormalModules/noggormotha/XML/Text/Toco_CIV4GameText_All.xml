		<English>It had been Ersorn, the abbot of the Order, who had the idea. He had been thought to be wise and so the others had followed his plan to bind N&#244;ggormotha by trapping her insider their bodies. It was his luck that he died during the capture. Oh, Ersorn wasn't the one who had to stand the tempting whispers of the demon of torture after it had been done. He was not the one who wanted to kill his brothers during the nights, listening to the honey sweet voice inside oh them. And he was not the one who gave the advice to leave the monastery and to get as much space and time between themselves as possible. Just to keep the demon quiet and to keep the beloved brothers alive. They were. The keepers of N&#244;ggormotha, damned to live a lonely life, parted from their friends and brothers and always living in fear to face them on the battlefield some day. What a fool Ersorn had been!</English>

		<German>Es war Ersorn gewesen, der Abt des Ordens, der die Idee gehabt hatte. Er war als weise angesehen worden und so folgten die anderen seinem Plan, N&#244;ggormotha zu binden, indem man sie in den eigenen K&#246;rpern einsperrte. Es war sein Gl&#252;ck, dass er w&#228;hrend der Gefangennahme gestorben war. Oh, Ersorn war nicht derjenige, der die verf&#252;hrerischen Einfl&#252;sterungen der D&#228;monin der Folter ertragen musste, nachdem es vollbracht war. Er war nicht derjenige, der seine Br&#252;der w&#228;hrend der N&#228;chte t&#246;ten wollte, der honigs&#252;&#223;en Stimme in ihnen lauschend. Und er war nicht der gewesen, der den Rat gab, das Kloster zu verlassen und so viel Raum und Zeit zwischen sich zu bringen, wie m&#246;glich. Einfach nur, um die D&#228;monin zu beruhigen und die geliebten Br&#252;der am Leben zu lassen. Sie waren es gewesen. Die H&#252;ter der N&#244;ggormotha, zu einem einsamen Leben verdammt, getrennt von ihren Freunden und Br&#252;dern und st&#228;ndig in Angst lebend, ihnen doch eines Tages auf dem Schlachtfeld gegen&#252;ber zu stehen. Was f&#252;r ein Narr Ersorn gewesen war!</German>

		<English>Every time a keeper of N&#244;ggormotha kills one of his brothers, he gains all of the power of the demon that lived within his opponent.

		<English>After the death of the last of his brothers of his order the only left keeper of N&#244;ggormotha was standing still and took a deep breath. The blissful grin on his face grew bigger and bigger. He succeeded. Noone would ever be a threat to him now and ever again. He teetered back and forth and silently enjoyed his triumph. Inspired by N&#244;ggormotha's powers he knew, a greater fate was his now.
He watched the sky grew darker. How the storm came out of nowhere and how the wind died away all out of a sudden. No sound was to be heard. He became unsteady. Adrenaline ran through his veins. What the hell . was happening? His stomach ached. He was really sick. His forehead burned like all fires of hell together. He tumbled and collapsed. Crawling on the ground and looking for safe grip he vomited and passed out.
When he regained consciousness, he heard a giggle, that grew into a high and scornful laugh. He looked up and looked into the grimace-like face of a tall women. Except for her evil eyes and her disfigered mouth she was very beautiful. Clad in red gold and sourrounded by a creepy wreath of swords, there was no other way for the spectator to admit that she was as dangerous as she was impressive. She looked at him, amused. Her ridiculing tone of voice was not to be overheard.: 'Thank you so much. Are you alright? Have you got used to me so much that the longing for sickened you right the moment I left your body? But yes, I admit, I would cry, too. You have no idea how to use my powers! How you will be screaming as soon as you realize, how perfect I am at giving pain and doom to hose who dare to stand in my way. Do you want to know?' She smiled at him and with having said what she wanted, N&#244;ggormotha, the Mistress of Torture, turned around and was gone.

		<German>Nach der Vernichtung des letzten Bruders aus seinem Orden stand der einzig verbliebene H&#252;ter der N&#244;ggormotha da und atmete tief durch. Das selige Grinsen auf seinem Gesicht wurde breiter und breiter. Er hatte es geschafft. Niemand w&#252;rde ihm jetzt noch gef&#228;hrlich werden k&#246;nnen. Er wippte leicht hin und her und genoss seinen Triumph. Beseelt von den Kr&#228;ften N&#244;ggormothas war ihm ein gr&#246;&#223;eres Schicksal zugedacht. 
Er beobachtete, wie sich der Himmel verdunkelte, wie es zu st&#252;rmen begann und wie sich der Wind mit einem Mal legte. Kein einziger Laut war zu h&#246;ren. Er wurde unruhig. Adrenalin schoss durch seinen K&#246;rper. Was passierte hier? Sein Bauch schmerzte. Ihm war furchtbar &#252;bel. Seine Stirn gl&#252;hte. Er schwankte und sank in sich zusammen. Am Boden liegend erbrach er sich. Er wurde ohnm&#228;chtig. 
Als er wieder zu sich kam, h&#246;rte er ein Kichern, das zu einem hohen und h&#246;hnischen Lachen anschwoll. Er blickte auf und erblickte in ein fratzenartiges Gesicht einer hochgewachsenen Frau, abgesehen von ihrem boshaften Augen und dem entstellten Mund war sie wundersch&#246;n. In rotes Gold gekleidet und von einem unheimlichen Schwerterkranz umgeben, blieb dem Betrachter keine Wahl, als anzuerkennen, dass sie sowohl gef&#228;hrlich als auch beeindruckend war. Sie blickte am&#252;siert auf ihn hinab. Ihre Stimme hatte einen nicht zu &#252;berh&#246;renden sp&#246;ttischen Tonfall:  "Vielen Dank. Geht es Euch gut? Habt Ihr Euch so an mich gew&#246;hnt gehabt, dass Ihr vor Sehnsucht in dem Moment erkranktet, da ich Euren K&#246;rper verlie&#223;? Doch ich w&#252;rde auch weinen. Ihr wisst doch gar nichts mit meiner Kraft anzufangen. Was werdet Ihr erst heulen, wenn Ihr erkennt, wie perfekt ich Leid und Verderben denen bringe, die sich mir in den Weg stellen. Wollt Ihr es erfahren?" Sie l&#228;chelte ihn an und damit machte N&#244;ggormotha, die Meisterin der Folter, auf dem Absatz kehrt und verschwand aus seinem Blick.

There were candles, and unpleasant scents of surely poisonous plants in the air. The shrine was closed, as it was common with the Keeper being at home. Arlon, the Sheaim keeper these days had invited them and they had talked about old times back at their monastery. . Things were easier with their new people having agreed on open borders or a defense alliance, just like in his and Turno's case who was the third person in the room. And about the fate of their other old friends. Some of them were gone forever. Missing. Killed. What a shame. They should not have fought N&#244;ggormotha for nothing. One thing was a fact.  An unknown traitor of their own order was trying to unite as much of the demon's power on his own person by killing his brothers. However, Arlon never had been the guy who calls people from far away to his place just to have a small chat about dead friends and a glass of old bitter wine. There was more about it. He was sure about this. But Arlon was not looking as if he wanted to talk about it. He had changed a lot since their last meeting. His bloodshot eyes showed no understanding anymore. His skin had turned very pale and was laced with unhealthy looking spots and ulcers. And suddenly, out of nowhere, he opened his mouth and laughed. And the laugh was not friendly. The laugh was a whole conversation: 'You are fools. I am the traitor. I will take your demonic strength. I want to have N&#244;ggormotha's powers. And you had no clue about it at all until now. But don't worry. I will let you leave unharmed. You pets!' And the laugh's message became true. They just had entered a dark ritual.</English>
