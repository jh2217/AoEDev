		<English>The Tribal Law civic gives control of the Chislev nation to five tribes, with a leader of one of those tribes acting as Head Chief. While the Head Chief has the final say in decisions, the other tribal chiefs advise the Head Chief. A new Head Chief will be appointed the turn you adopt Tribal Law, and every 45/60/90/180 turns thereafter, depending on your game speed. Your leader can come from the following tribes:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Eagle Tribe: [LINK=LEADER_SHIMASANI]Shimasani[\LINK] ([LINK=TRAIT_CHARISMATIC]Charismatic[\LINK]/[LINK=TRAIT_TRADER]Trader[\LINK])[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Coyote Tribe: [LINK=LEADER_SOYALA]Soyala[\LINK] ([LINK=TRAIT_CREATIVE]Creative[\LINK]/[LINK=TRAIT_PIONEER]Imperalist[\LINK])[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Bear Tribe: [LINK=LEADER_MOTSQUEH]Motsqueh[\LINK] ([LINK=TRAIT_EXPANSIVE]Expansive[\LINK]/[LINK=TRAIT_INDUSTRIOUS]Industrious[\LINK])[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Serpent Tribe: [LINK=LEADER_OSYKA]Osyka[\LINK] ([LINK=TRAIT_AGGRESSIVE]Aggressive[\LINK]/[LINK=TRAIT_RAIDERS]Raiders[\LINK])[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Tortoise Tribe: [LINK=LEADER_ALOSAKA]Alosaka[\LINK] ([LINK=TRAIT_PHILOSOPHICAL]Philosophical[\LINK]/[LINK=TRAIT_DEFENDER]Defender[\LINK])[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]During elections, you may vote for a different leader, the same leader, allow the game to randomize it for you, or decide not to hold an election. If you vote for the same leader, you will have a turn of anarchy unless that leader is Shimasani; however, there will also be a 50% chance of a positive effect. For Shimasani, it's +3 relations with all other leaders. For Soyala, Motsqueh, and Osyka, they get a Great Bard, Great Engineer, or Great Commander respectively. For Alosaka, he will enter a golden age. Picking a different leader simply switches to that leader, and your alignment resets to that leader's alignment. Allowing the game to randomize for you picks one of the five options at random, and gives you one turn of "We Love the Head Chief Day". If it happens to pick the leader you currently are, you will not suffer a turn of anarchy. The last option, to not hold an election, is only useful if you want to remain as [LINK=LEADER_CHISLEV]Absaroke[\LINK] or [LINK=LEADER_NATANE]Natane[\LINK] while operating under Tribal Law.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]While under Tribal Law, all units that you acquire will come from one of the five tribes at random, with the exception of [LINK=UNIT_MESKWAKI]Meskwaki[\LINK], who will always be from the Bear Tribe. If you train a unit in a source totem city, the unit is guaranteed to be from that tribe, whether you're using Tribal Law or not. The units will start with a promotion depending on their tribe, and if they would have already received that promotion from another source, it gets incremented to its next level:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Eagle Tribe: [LINK=PROMOTION_MOBILITY1]Mobility[\LINK][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Coyote Tribe:[LINK=PROMOTION_DRILL1]Drill[\LINK][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Bear Tribe: [LINK=PROMOTION_COMBAT1]Combat[\LINK][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Serpent Tribe: [LINK=PROMOTION_CITY_RAIDER1]City Raider[\LINK][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Tortoise Tribe: [LINK=PROMOTION_CITY_GARRISON1]City Garrison[\LINK][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Tribal Law also unlocks the ability to create the [LINK=UNIT_MENAWA]Menawa[\LINK] unit. While not entirely powerful on its own, it can be unlocked fairly early at [LINK=TECH_MILITARY_STRATEGY]Military Strategy[\LINK], and comes with one of five unique abilities depending on what tribe you wish the unit to come from:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Eagle Tribe: Ignores terrain costs, +1 Movement Range[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Coyote Tribe: 10% chance to avoid bad lair results, 10% withdrawal chance, 100% extra gold from pillaging, and a 10% chance to do 5% damage when this unit's stack is attacked[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Bear Tribe: +1 offensive and defensive strength[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Serpent Tribe: 15% chance to generate a slave after combat, attacks the weakest unit in the stack[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Tortoise Tribe: +10% defensive strength, double fortification bonus, and guards against enemy Marksman units[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If you move away from the Tribal Law civic, your Menawa units will abandon you.</English>
