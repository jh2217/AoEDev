		<English>[TAB]A jagged outcrop of islands lay ahead of The Marionette, prized flagship of the Belsaraph city-states; patchwork colors of every hue cover the sails as two sailors argue up in the crow's nest.

"The coordinates we got from the Lanun have been way off; I don't see the mainland anywhere!" said the first sailor. 

"Nonsense, they have no reason to mislead us; our gold was as good as anyone's, see? Those islands ahead mean land must be just behind them!" said the second.

"Do you call that land?? There is not a single living thing on those ridges besides barnacles and... and..." said the first sailor, trailing off.

The first sailor's face started to go a funny shade of purple and green.

"What the hell has gotten into you?" said the second sailor.

"T-That island just blinked at me!" said the first.

Suddenly the waves around The Marionette exploded into froth and roil as the ship started to lift up into the air, stranded on the flipper of a megalithic beast from nightmare.

"THOSE BASTARDS SET US-" The second sailor's words were cut off as the ship pitched violently, a deafening roar filling the skies, causing every board in the vessel to vibrate. Tumbling out of the crow's nest, all the second sailor could do was watch helplessly as the roil rushed up to meet him.

		

The Marionette was the prized flagship of the Balserath city-states, and now it was flotsam floating around a jagged outcrop of islands that did not exist on any map.</English>
