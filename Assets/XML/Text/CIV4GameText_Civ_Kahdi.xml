		<English>The Kahdi as a people are self-named - literally "The Followers of Kahd". They are not a familial tribe or ancient line of people, but a product of the Age of Rebirth. They have come together under the leadership of Kahd, a seemingly popular wizard dedicated to Oghma and the pursuit of greater knowledge.[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH]Of course, nothing is ever quite as it seems. Kahd's popularity is not due to his "winning personality" (in fact, he's quite arrogant) but his talents at subtle thought manipulation. He isn't just a dedicated follower of Oghma - he considers himself to be the "Chosen Servant" of the god in Creation. His ambitions are great and he seeks to empower himself and his followers to stand above all others in Creation.[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH]In fact - he's actually partially correct. He *is* the chosen agent of a higher power, but that power is not Oghma.</English>

		<English>He was unperturbed. In fact, the thing that concerned him most was that he had been utterly unconcerned about the sacking of Nimarail. The town he had grown up in, home to hundreds of the Amurite people, one of the most progressive centres of magical knowledge in creation - had fallen by his order. In fact, it had not been as simple as giving the order. He had planned the coup for months - ensuring that his followers were well placed and his allies within the city were trustworthy. Throughout that period of planning, he had suffered a nagging doubt - fully aware that this action would put him permanently at odds with his old people. He had expected to feel guilt, remorse, even sorrow - but now as he stood before the library of Nimarail for the first time in decades, he felt none of these things. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]True, he was now considered a traitor and several of those whom would have once considered themselves his teachers had been slain - so many had been slain, more than he had hoped would be necessary - but surely the ends justified these means. Afterall, very soon the Kahdi would know all that the Amurites had learnt since he left them as a young man. Combined with the knowledge he had earned himself, he alone would be the greatest of wizards - and worthy of his god's recognition. More than that - this specific library held knowledge of what he had long sought. Knowledge that the Amurites would have denied him.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Stepping over the body of the curator he strode between the library's lofty stacks and began his search.</English>

Even though their concious memories are destroyed by the mist's effect - the Gnoslings retain their affinity for knowledge and passively seek for it, drifting toward centres of information. Sometimes, they will slip into Creation through portals created by mortals in search of the knowledge of men. The Kahdi have created permanent portals to encourage them to do so.</English>

If he could control all the beings of creation, surely even the gods would marvel at his power - for they themselves have never succeeeded in such a feat.

The angel also granted him certain knowledge that allowed him to access Oghma's vault directly - after a fashion.
