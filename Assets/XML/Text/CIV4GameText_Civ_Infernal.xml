But that will is strengthened by Hyborem's demonic desires, and his underlings' abject fear of him.

		<Italian>[TAB]Gli Infernali entrano in gioco in seguito alla scoperta della tecnologia [LINK=TECH_INFERNAL_PACT]Patto Infernale[\LINK]. Iniziano inoltre con delle potenti unità, tra cui il loro eroe, Hyborem.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Gli Infernali ottengono gratuitamente gli edifici: [LINK=BUILDING_ELDER_COUNCIL]Consiglio degli Anziani[\LINK], [LINK=BUILDING_TRAINING_YARD]Campo d'Addestramento[\LINK], [LINK=BUILDING_OBSIDIAN_GATE]Portale D'Ossidiana[\LINK], [LINK=BUILDING_FORGE]Fucina[\LINK], [LINK=BUILDING_MAGE_GUILD]Gilda dei Maghi[\LINK] e [LINK=BUILDING_DEMONIC_CITIZENS]Cittadini Demoniaci[\LINK] in ognuna delle loro città. Le loro città iniziano inoltre con la religione [LINK=RELIGION_THE_ASHEN_VEIL]Velo Cinereo[\LINK], e la religione [LINK=RELIGION_THE_ORDER]Ordine[\LINK] viene rimossa automaticamente dalle città che conquistano.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]Origine:[\H1]Cosa può essere peggiore dell'inferno? Il dominio di un dio caduto, i cui sussurri sono presenti in ogni religione.[PARAGRAPH:1]"I malvagi sarannò puniti in eterno all'inferno" dice il Confessore.[PARAGRAPH:1]"I suoi fuochi ardono più caldi di qualsiasi fucina, e gli stolti vengono inceneriti come fossero oro falso" ammonisce il Custode della Pietra.[PARAGRAPH:1]"I giorni più caldi dell'estate non sono paragonabili" intona il Sacerdote delle Foglie, "e non vi è rinascita per i profanatori li esiliati."[PARAGRAPH:1]I Cultisti farfugliano, "Nel fuoco o nel vuoto, i vostri maestri non possono parlare con voi, ne voi con loro; rifuggite il reame del sole caduto, e non vacillate negli incarichi per i vostri signori, o verrete banditi!"[PARAGRAPH:1]E nei rituali del Velo Cinereo sono presenti queste parole: "Dai fuochi della fossa provegono i nostri segreti, ma noi riconosciamo che siamo solo dei supplicanti, e offriamo il prezzo che richedi. Veniamo per contrattare, non comandare, oh Signori dell'oscurità e delle fiamme eterne. Per questa presunzione non prendere le nostre anime, ma bensì quelle dei nostri nemici."[PARAGRAPH:1]Eppure la verità è molto peggio. L'inferno attacca ogni aspetto delle anime ivi presenti. Una straziante fucina creata per transfomrmare i deboli e sconfitti in manifestazioni fisiche dell'odio di Agares per la vita. In vita un'uomo può ritenere un'atto impensabile, ma attraverso le lente manipolazioni dell'inferno tale atto diventerà accettabile e persino piacevole. In molti passano l'eternità in questa maniera, odiando quelli sopra di loro e schiacciando quelli sotto di loro.[PARAGRAPH:1]Hyborem però non era soddisfatto e desiderava nuove sfide. Con l'aiuto segreto di Agares le barriere della creazione furono indebolite impercettibilmente da rituali appresi dal Velo Cinereo. L'inferno, che coesisteva sempre al fianco del piano infinito dei mortali, ottenne una breve e contorta via d'accesso. Hyborem prese i suoi servitori e partì immediatamente.[PARAGRAPH:1]Loro furono costretti a creare la loro città con le loro mani quando questa realtà si rifiutò di assecondare la loro volontà. La stessa volontà che viene rafforzata dai desideri demoniaci di Hyborem e dalla paura di lui dei suoi sottoposti. Impulsivo e impaziente Hyborem è nondimeno astuto e disposto ad osservare i regni degli uomini, e persino ad imparare da loro come agire su questo piano, fino a quando i suoi obiettivi non saranno raggiunti e potrà portare quanti più mortali all'inferno per tormentarli per l'eternità.</Italian>

		<English>[TAB]Ethne tossed in her sleep. She was haunted with visions of wicked step-sisters, Sidney in her blue and yellow dress, Dain, and a dinner table that extended into darkness. Tomorrow she would have to decide if she was going to commit her people to a war against the Infernal that many would never return from. If she didn't the Infernals would crush the Amurites, who were already on the verge of collapse. But if she joined the war it would escalate further and even more would die.[PARAGRAPH:1]In her dream Hyborem sat at the end of the dinner table.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Your logic guides you to one decision, and your morality to another." Hyborem stated.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Yes." Ethne found herself unable to lie to the Lord of the Balors.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Morality is an illusion, a dream without reason. It is the shifting wind." There was no trace of magical persuasion in Hyborem's voice and Ethne was free to respond as she wanted.[PARAGRAPH:1]"A queen must be more than an accountant emotionlessly weighing one option against each other. Morality sets our goals, logic tells us how to achieve them."[PARAGRAPH:1]Hyborem smiled, though it was empty of emotion.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Imagine that you stand on your palace wall..."[PARAGRAPH:1]As Hyborem spoke Ethne could see the city surrounding her palace. It was a quiet autumn night and the city was lit by occasional lanterns and moonlight. Then guard bells rang out. Ethne could see men running along the street. Five ran along the palace walls seeking the security of the palace gate. Another man ran off into the city.[PARAGRAPH:1]Guards along the palace walls starting shouting warnings and a werewolf lumbered out of the shadows, chasing after the group of five men. The five men rushed through the palace gate and the men called for Ethne's order, if they should drop the gate portcullis or not.[PARAGRAPH:1]"If you close the portcullis" Hyborem's voice cut through the scene, "the five will live, but the werewolf will turn on the single man running into the city and kill him. You save five men, but you doom another. What is the morale thing to do?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"I would drop the portcullis and save the five men" Ethne answered. As she did she saw the scene play out. The werewolf turned and cut down the single man before fleeing the city.[PARAGRAPH:1]The scene changed, once again Ethne stood on the palace wall, and once again the guard bells started ringing. Five men ran along the palace wall, but there was no man running into the city. Instead a man stood beside her on the wall, watching the attack below.[PARAGRAPH:1]This time the werewolf was closer, the five men wouldn't be able to reach the palace gate in time.[PARAGRAPH:1]Hyborem's voice cut in again, "Again five men will die if you do nothing. Again you can save them by sacrificing one man. But this time you must push that man off the palace wall. If you push him he will fall in front of the werewolf, who will stop to kill him, giving the five men enough time to get into the palace. What is the morale thing to do?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"I would not push the man off the castle wall." Ethne said confused.[PARAGRAPH:1]"This is the illusion of morality" Hyborem said as the scene faded back to the room with the table between them, "In both cases you have the same options, but you make different decisions in the name of morality. If you want to stand against the Infernal do it because it will save the most lives, it will increase your power, you will gain the treasures of hell. But do not allow your throne to be ruled by the wind."[PARAGRAPH:1]Ethne awoke, it was dawn and her meeting with the Amurite diplomats was a few hours away. She didn't feel like she had gotten any sleep at all, and the day was only going to get worse.</English>

		<Italian>[TAB]Ethne si agitò nel sonno. Era perseguitata dalle visioni delle sorellastre malvagie, Sidney nel suo vetito blu e giallo, Dain, e un tavolo da pranzo che si estendeva nell'oscurità. L'indomani avrebbe dovuto decidere se impegnare la sua gente in una guerra contro gli Infernali dalla quale in molti non sarebbero tornati. Se invece rimaneva neutrale gli Infernali avrebbero schiacciato gli Amurite, che erano già sull'orlo del collasso. Ma se lei si univa alla guerra essa sarebbe peggiorata ancor di più e molti altri sarebbero morti.[PARAGRAPH:1]Nel suo incubo Hyborem sedeva alla fine del tavolo da pranzo.[PARAGRAPH:1]"La tua logica ti porta a una conclusione, e la tua moralità ad un'altra." Hyborem dichiarò.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Si." Ethne si trovò incapace di mentire al Signore dei Balor.[PARAGRAPH:1]"La moralità è un'illusione, un sogno senza ragione. È un vento in continuo cambiamento." Non vi era traccia di persuasione magica nella voce di Hyborem e Ethne era libera di rispondere come voleva.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Una regina deve essere più di un semplice ragioniere che valuta senza emozione un'opzione rispetto ad un'altra. La moralità definisce i nostri obiettivi, la logica ci dice come raggiungerli."[PARAGRAPH:1]Hyborem sorrise, sebbene fosse senza emozione.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Immagina di stare sulle mura del tuo palazzo..."[PARAGRAPH:1]Mentre Hyborem parlava Ethne poteva vedere la città che circondava il suo palazzo. Era una tranquilla notte autunnale e la città era illuminata dalle occasionali lanterne e dalla luce della luna. Poi le campane delle guardie suonarono. Ethne poteva vedere uomini correre per le strade. In cinque corserò lungo le mura del palazzo cercando rifugio nel cancello del palazzo. Un'altro invece corse verso il centro della città.[PARAGRAPH:1]Le guardie lungo le mura del palazzo iniziaro ad urlare avvertimenti e un lupo mannaro usci dalle ombre, inseguendo il gruppo di cinque uomini. Essi passarono di corsa nel cancello e le guardie chieserò ordini ad Ethne, se abbassare la grata del cancello o no.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Se abbassi la grata" la voce di Hyborem si inserì nella scena, "i cinque vivranno, ma il lupo mannaro andrà dal singolo uomo che sta andando in città e lo ucciderà. Salvi cinque persone, ma ne condanni un'altra. Qual è la cosa morale da fare?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Farei abbassare la grata e salverei i cinque uomini" Ethne rispose. Mentre lo diceva vide la scena compiersi. Il lupo mannaro si voltò e uccise l'uomo solitario prima di fuggire dalla città.[PARAGRAPH:1]La scena cambiò, di nuovo Ethne stava sulle mura del palazzo, e di nuovo le campane delle guardie suonarono. Cinque uomini stavano correndo sotto le mura del palazzo, ma nessuno stava correndo verso la città. Invece un'uomo stava al suo fianco sulle mura, osservando l'attacco sottostante.[PARAGRAPH:1]Questa volta il lupo mannaro era più vicino, i cinque uomini non sarebbero riusciti a raggiungere il cancello del palazzo in tempo.[PARAGRAPH:1]La voce di Hyborem si inserì di nuovo, "Di nuovo cinque uomini moriranno se tu non fai niente. Di nuovo puoi salvarli sacrificandone uno. Ma questa volta devi spingerlo giù dalle mura. Se lo fai lui cadrà davanti al lupo mannaro, che si fermerà per ucciderlo, fornendo ai cinque uomini abbastanza tempo per entrare nel palazzo.Qual è la cosa morale da fare?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Non spingerei l'uomo giù dalle mura." Ethne disse confusa.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Questa è l'illusione della moralità" Hyborem disse mentre la scena tornava ad essere quella con il tavolo tra di loro, "In entrambi i casi tu hai la stessa opzione, ma prendi decisioni diverse nel nome della moralità. Se vuoi ergerti contro gli Infernali fallo perché salverà il maggior numero di vite, aumenterà la tua influenza e otterrai i tesori dell'inferno. Ma non permettere al tuo trono di essere governato dal vento."[PARAGRAPH:1]Ethne si svegliò, era mattina e il suo incontro con i diplomatici Amurite era fra qualche ora. Si sentiva come se non avesse minimamente dormito, e la giornata sarebbe solo peggiorata.</Italian>

Instead a man stood beside her on the wall, watching the attack below.[PARAGRAPH:1]This time the werewolf was closer, the five men wouldn't be able to reach the palace gate in time.[PARAGRAPH:1]Hyborem's voice cut in again, "Again five men will die if you do nothing. Again you can save them by sacrificing one man. But this time you must push that man off the palace wall. If you push him he will fall in front of the werewolf, who will stop to kill him, giving the five men enough time to get into the palace. What is the morale thing to do?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"I would not push the man off the castle wall." Ethne said confused.[PARAGRAPH:1]"This is the illusion of morality" Hyborem said as the scene faded back to the room with the table between them, "In both cases you have the same options, but you make different decisions in the name of morality. If you want to stand against the Infernal do it because it will save the most lives, it will increase your power, you will gain the treasures of hell. But do not allow your throne to be ruled by the wind."[PARAGRAPH:1]Ethne awoke, it was dawn and her meeting with the Amurite diplomats was a few hours away. She didn't feel like she had gotten any sleep at all, and the day was only going to get worse.</Spanish>

Alcuni dicono che un Cavaliere della Morte può essere creato solo dallo spirito di un Cavaliere che ha infranto i suoi giuramenti di fedeltà, ma molti Cavalieri temono segretamente che gli Infernali conoscano un modo per trascinare persino il più nobile degli spiriti all'inferno e renderlo un loro vassallo. Questo timore li spinge a compiere atti di pietà come neppure un decreto regale riuscirebbe, e raro è il Cavaliere che non chiede una benedizione a qualsiasi sacerdote di passaggio.</Italian>

Vengono donati alla civiltà Infernale e possono venir migliorati in altre unità o aggiunti alla popolazione di una città.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*Le unità malvagie sono quelle con la religione Velo Cinereo, Concilio di Esus o Octopus overlords.

		<English>Donal had been riding for days, and each day as he pushed further into the desert, the air had become more and more stifling, the sun more and more obscured by a haze. He had been told what was coming, the hunters had sent their hawk ahead and the news was never good. It was on the third day that he began to see the corpses, animal, human, in one hollow grave the bodies of a handful of dwarfs, all disembowelled, with their tongues cut out and their eye sockets empty.[NEWLINE] As each league passed, the swarms of flies grew more dense, the buzzing louder, and the sickly sweet smell stronger and thicker. Many of the men had taken to soaking rags in wine and tying it around their faces, but even the close smell of fermented grapes and spices did little to stave off the air, that had itself become a messenger from the Fields of Perdition, one that could not be met with sweat and steel.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Ignoring the mortals need for armor smashing maces, the Infernals developed a method of infusing Iron with the souls of powerful mages, damned in their pursuit of power. A strike from a demon so equipped will leave a festering wound, passing though metal armor as if it weren't there. The aftermath of a battle with these twisted warriors leaves a stench on the battle field like no other, attracting flies to the wounds of agonizing warriors.</English>

		<German>Ohne auf die Bedürfnisse nach Rüstung durchschlagenden Hiebwaffen eingehen zu müssen, haben die Infernalen eine Methode entwickelt, die es ihnen ermöglicht, Eisen in die Seelen von mächtigen Magiern zu gießen, die von der Gier nach Macht verfolgt werden. Ein Schlag von einem so ausgerüsteten Dämon hinterläßt eine schwärende Wunde, die sich durch Metallrüstung frißt, als wäre diese nicht vorhanden. Die Nachwirkungen eines Kampfes mit solch veränderten Kriegern hinterläßt einen Gestank wie bei keinem anderen, was Fliegen anzieht, um sich an den Wunden der leidenden Krieger zu laben.</German>
		<Italian>Donal aveva cavalcato per giorni, ogni giorno inoltrandosi sempre di più nel deserto con l'aria che diventava via via sempre più soffocante e il sole sempre più oscurato da una foschia. Gli era stato riferito cosa era in arrivo, i cacciatori avevano mandato avanti i loro falchi e le notizie non erano mai buone. Fù nel terzo giorno che iniziò a vedere i cadaveri, animali, umani, in una tomba aperta una manciata di nani, tutti sventrati, con le loro lingue tagliate e le cavità ocualri vuote.[NEWLINE] Ogni ora che passava lo sciame di mosche diventava sempre più denso, il ronzio più forte, e l'odore dolciastro più opprimente. Molti uomini avevano iniziato a inumidire degli stracci con il vino per metterseli sul naso, ma persino l'odore del vino e di spezie non migliorava l'aria, che era diventata un messaggero dai Campi della Perdizione, uno che non poteva essere affrontato col sudore e l'acciaio.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Ignorando il bisogno dei mortali per delle mazze per rompere le armature, gli Infernali svilupparono un metodo per infondere il ferro con le anime di potenti maghi, dannati nella loro ricerca del potere. Un colpo da un demone cosi equipaggiato lascerà una ferita infetta, oltrepassando l'armatura come se non ci fosse. In seguito ad una battaglia con questi guerrieri innaturali sul campo di battaglia rimane un tanfo unico, che attrae le mosche alle ferite dei guerrieri agonizzanti. </Italian>
