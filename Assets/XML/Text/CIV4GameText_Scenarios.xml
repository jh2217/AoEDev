		<English>Decius returns home and spends a night feasting and telling tales with the men of his Father's holdings. Rosier's parting words haunt him, however, and he retires early. From under his bed comes an inky black snake, hissing and swaying as it crawls up him. Decius tries to grab it but cannot move, and the snake speaks to him. "Noble one... you serve loyally and unquestioningly. How is your service repaid? Such a hard life. Surely such skill and valor as yours should be better rewarded. You deserve power and wealth beyond your station. Is honor such a dear currency to you?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Finally Decius finds his voice. "Away!" He reaches for the snake, but it slithers away, under his bed. Decius reaches for it, finally grasping the thing and strangling it with his bare hands until...[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Until he awakes to his father's voice. "Are you alright my son... Decius, by god, what are you doing?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Decius is on his knees with his hands wrapped around an octopus-headed idol which glows faintly in the dark.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"I had a nightmare. A demon was tempting me, and..."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"And it looks to me like you gave in. I would have never thought you capable of this blasphemy. But nor would I have suspected Rosier, either. We shall leave this for the Confessors to determine."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"I have seen how the Order judges, and would ask you to trust your own judgment. Trust your own son!"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"I must rather trust my own eyes, Decius."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Then I guess I must trust my feet, Lord Commander." Decius swung, smacking his father with the idol. His father staggered back, and Decius rushed past, heading for the stables before alarm could be given.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]He was a fugitive, which is almost as bad as a confession. He would have no succor within the Empire. And the Empire's reach was well beyond its borders-forts lie north, east, and south. And to the west lie the Lanun. He almost stopped. He believed in law, in order, he had sworn his life to the unending crusade against evil. A hundred times he had risked that life on the field of battle. But he would not die the heretic's death, reviled and anathematized.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The diviners would not look at his valorous history, nor could they what had actually happened. They would look into his heart, and read any doubt as disloyalty.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]He spurred his horse toward the west.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]When he arrived in Innsmouth there was a ship heading across the great sea, carrying spices, furs, and slaves. He was recognized as their enemy-but not, to his luck, as their commander. His horse, and the bit of gold he had in her saddlebag bought him one way passage, no questions asked. Or just one question.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"We go to the desert of Myrh, Bannorman. We can let you off with the Calabim, or you can hire a guide to take you to a Malakim city. What is your choice?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE](The civilization you choose will determine what civilization you play as in future scenarios)</English>

I can offer the loyalty of the Calabim in exchange."</Spanish>

		<English>After the third group of hunters went missing, Decius started to get upset. The trip south from the lands that he had conquered around Tempus Mor was rife with danger, as mountain passes ended in steep drops as often as not, and even the gentle slopes led down into mist-filled valleys with treacherous bogs and swamplands. They were easy prey at night; even the Nightwatch would often be found slain in the morning. He began to wish that his whole group had taken the sea route again, but he hadn't wanted to risk Overcouncil or Sidar forces coming in from the north and pinching them against the main Sidar army.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Even the Svartalfar hunters who guided them, experts at avoiding detection, would find some among their numbers poached.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Then one morning they awoke to find a whole company of bloodpets dead. Decius ground his teeth as the bit of sun that came through the thick clouds illuminated the grisly scene.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Commander, may we speak?" The voice came from above as the speaker slowly descended. A succubus, sent with word of Os-Gabella's offer and to assist Decius. It was less an offer and more a plea; were he to return with the blade that slew Ethne of the Elohim, he could name his price from the old sorceress. It was too tempting of an offer for him to pass up, not to mention the value he would get from using these Sidar as his personal spies should he subdue them. But just finding them was proving a most difficult quest.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Yes, what is it?" Decius averted his eyes from her shapely, and nude, form, not out of modesty but because he didn't want to be reminded at the moment of another woman whose company he had recently kept, the druid Talia Gosam.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"You are a wise commander, but you are still blind to some of the options that are open to you. Why do you grieve the loss of these troops?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"I'm not in the mood for games, creature. What is your suggestion?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"They did not serve you willingly in life; why let them take to death against your wishes? We can animate these bodies, and send them ahead. Let the Sidar ghosts strike with their poisoned blades against hearts no longer beating."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Yes, we'll make them strike twice for every kill."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Furthermore, their assassins have been aiming for our scouts and workers, or other weaker troops. Let us petition Esus to deceive their eyes. For Agares to grant us allies more at home in the darkness than our foes are. To Aeron, for strength to fight frenzied even when poisoned and dying. And most importantly, to Ceridwen, for the secret knowledge the great seer holds."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"I don't like seeking the help of gods. They usually take more than they give."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Our gods will not collect on their debt for some time Decius. Their goals align with yours, and they do not seek to pull your strings, as you already follow their path. Their price is cheaper than losing your head to an assassin's blade."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Decius stared at the demon for a moment. "Very well. What is needed?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The ritual was prepared. Decius's blood was spilled into the fires, and he recited the prayers. In the dancing flames, the valley was illuminated, showing the path to take to the enemy's gates."</English>

The voice came from above as the speaker slowly descended. A succubus, sent with word of Os-Gabella's offer and to assist Decius. It was less an offer and more a plea; were he to return with the blade that slew Ethne of the Elohim, he could name his price from the old sorceress. It was too tempting of an offer for him to pass up, not to mention the value he would get from using these Sidar as his personal spies should he subdue them. But just finding them was proving a most difficult quest.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Yes, what is it?" Decius averted his eyes from her shapely, and nude, form, not out of modesty but because he didn't want to be reminded at the moment of another woman whose company he had recently kept, the druid Talia Gosam.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"You are a wise commander, but you are still blind to some of the options that are open to you. Why do you grieve the loss of these troops?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"I'm not in the mood for games, creature. What is your suggestion?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"They did not serve you willingly in life; why let them take to death against your wishes? We can animate these bodies, and send them ahead. Let the Sidar ghosts strike with their poisoned blades against hearts no longer beating."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Yes, we'll make them strike twice for every kill."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Furthermore, their assassins have been aiming for our scouts and workers, or other weaker troops. Let us petition Esus to deceive their eyes. For Agares to grant us allies more at home in the darkness than our foes are. To Aeron, for strength to fight frenzied even when poisoned and dying. And most importantly, to Ceridwen, for the secret knowledge the great seer holds."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"I don't like seeking the help of gods. They usually take more than they give."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Our gods will not collect on their debt for some time Decius. Their goals align with yours, and they do not seek to pull your strings, as you already follow their path. Their price is cheaper than losing your head to an assassin's blade."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Decius stared at the demon for a moment. "Very well. What is needed?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The ritual was prepared. Decius's blood was spilled into the fires, and he recited the prayers. In the dancing flames, the valley was illuminated, showing the path to take to the enemy's gates."</Spanish>

		<English>The Elohim sent a guide to lead the Malakim to the Astur wastes, and the Ljosalfar lent a skilled elven tracker. The assassin Decius captured was bound and marched at the head of the column.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Still the winding paths claimed many as they traveled in pursuit of the hidden civilization of the Sidar. Mountain passes dropped into valleys cloaked in fog, filled with swamps and ruins. Even when not on the move, men disappeared at night, until a full score of Lightbringers were posted guard each sundown. Even so, the Sidar captive was taken back by his allies one night, out from under the Malakim guards. The next day Decius marched the Malakim forces harder, keeping scouting parties roving constantly around the main force but never out of sight of one another. And still nearly a third of his forces were cut off navigating a swampy valley in the dense fog, lost from the rest of the company. When Decius found out, he ordered his army to stop and set up camp at the nearest hilltop, deciding that it was time to try something new.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Greetings, lord," the Vicar said as Decius entered the tent used as temple. "Have you orders?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"No. I would like to pray." The Vicar nodded, lighting incense and beginning the recitation of Lugus's noontime prayer.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"I meant alone." Decius waited while the Vicar left. Decius stood, then knelt, then finally sat near the altar, arms crossed and staring into the brazier.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]This was a holy place, but Decius felt no special kinship to Lugus, despite his friend's devotion. Junil and  justice he had been taught to revere, but Decius had betrayed Junil's chosen people. Who should he turn to? Sirona, Ethne's patron? Sucellus, God of Life? Or... who? His theological knowledge didn't extend very deep, and shortly gave up trying to decide the best recipient of his pleas.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Oh gods who love justice and oppose the spreading darkness, hear me. I have failed you in the past, sometimes greatly. I have been rash and selfish, and am not a disciple of your ways. But you have failed me as well, or least your followers and laws have. Do not let my people die in this valley of death. A good woman's soul is doomed if we fail. And if the Calabim and their allies manage to subdue these Sidar ghosts, they stand to turn the tide of the war we've almost won. Surely the end of the world should draw your attention? Surely opposing this grave evil merits your favor? I am an imperfect champion, but do not let these good people suffer for my impurity. Show me the way, and I yield my will to you."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Decius waited briefly for a sign. Then sighed and left the tent.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The fog had lifted from the valley, and the clouds above had parted. The way was made clear. Hunters' hawks took flight. Soon they learned that they were not far from the enemy's borders, and the treacherous passage would be safer in this clear day.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Should we continue the march?" asked one of his commanders.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Not yet. Set up a permanent encampment here. This hill is the place of our deliverance, from where we will prepare to take the Sidar capital and their warriors as our vassals."</English>

		<English>"This is but a room," the voice said, "And your entrance here means nothing. We will leave this place and find another."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"This isn't the first of your cities that have been conquered, shade. I will not give up until you yield. The world is not as big as it once was, when it emerged from winter wild and open. Places to hide are running out."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Sandalphon appeared behind him. "What do you want, Decius? A Sidar assassin to strike against your father in Torrolerial? He has his hands full with the Doviello invasion, I think. We could slay Varn Gosam in his sleep, if you still despise him, or free you from your obligations to Flauros while he feeds."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"You know so much about me? I think it is time for you to start answering my questions."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Giving answers isn't what we do. We watch and plan and wait and, if absolutely necessary, we act, without the world knowing we were here. To preserve the Sidar and our seclusion." Sandalphon faded from view again. Decius turned to Losha Valus, and gestured to the slain shades scattered around the Sidar throne room. Losha and the other vampires accompanying Decius raised them as skeletons.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Face me Sandalphon, or every Sidar man, woman, and child we have killed or will ever find will be raised as a skeleton and sent to hunt you down. Will you enjoy your long life being forever invisible?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"No!" Sandalphon's rage was the first emotion he had shown. "Leave them be. You have no right to abuse the dead. These bodies are all that remains in this world of our friends, and you have no right to enslave them. I will yield to you."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Decius nodded, and Losha released the bodies of the slain shades. "I want to know why you attacked me."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"The Calabim are an intriguing people, not unlike us until recently. You have led them to be more aggressive with your leadership, since you did not face the hardship that they saw during the Age of Winter. After your success in the war of Tempus Mor, we predicted a resurgent Calabim ruling over the entire world, and feasting on the Sidar. The risk of this outweighed the risk of revealing ourselves, and so we activated our assassins in the area. Unfortunately, only Rathus accomplished his goal."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"He was the one who struck at the Elohim, then? I have a friend who badly wants his sword." Decius pulled out the Nether Blade that they had taken from Rathus's corpse and examined it. Green runes pulsed along the light ebon blade. "What makes this sword special?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"The Nether Blade is an artifact from the underworld. Its power draws any it slays into Arawns lands and anchors them in his vault."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Hmm. I think this might be better than whatever Os-Gabella could offer me. It isn't enough to compensate us for all that we have lost since your attack on us... but I dare not invite you into our midst; it would only be inviting my death. We will take what we need of your supplies and leave you here in peace, to live your long, quiet, isolated lives. But the secrets of the Sidar will be spread far and wide among the Calabim. If you strike at us again, everything that you have built will be destroyed and your people will be put to death and then enslaved until the end of time."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"This is as generous as we can expect from you, I am well aware," Sandalphon replied. Suddenly from behind him another ghost appeared, drawing their attention. "Belthus, welcome back," Sandalphon said. "How went your mission?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Auric Ulvin's war will not be stopped so easy. I could not get near him. He radiates with the power of Winter, a power not seen on Erebus for generations, and his army grows more numerous. It seems the endless winter is more likely than we thought."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Who is this Auric Ulvin?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Belthus, this is Decius of the Calabim. We were just discussing the future sovereignty of the Sidar in light of the Calabim's brutal conquest. Decius, we have our eye on more than just the nations nearest us. In the distant Aquillo Tundra occur events that could trouble us even here. Auric is a magical prodigy, and this power made him a suitable vessel for the machinations of the power of winter. Mulcarn was killed by the Godslayer, leaving his sphere without a suitable ruler. Auric has drawn together the tools of that god, and is preparing to become its avatar. Belthus was sent to stop him, but we acted too late. If the armies gathering against him do not stop him, he will return all Erebus to an Age of Winter."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Decius looked at the sword he held in his hands for a moment, then he sheathed it. "What if a god was not slain with the Godslayer, but trapped by the Nether Blade?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Sandalphon shrugged. "We have no experience with that."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Auric poses a grave threat. We will go to support those who stand against him, and if the Nether Blade staves off this threat for good, perhaps it can rid me of my troublesome allies as well."</English>

We will take what we need of your supplies and leave you here in peace, to live your long, quiet, isolated lives. But the secrets of the Sidar will be spread far and wide among the Calabim. If you strike at us again, everything that you have built will be destroyed and your people will be put to death and then enslaved until the end of time."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"This is as generous as we can expect from you, I am well aware," Sandalphon replied. Suddenly from behind him another ghost appeared, drawing their attention. "Belthus, welcome back," Sandalphon said. "How went your mission?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Auric Ulvin's war will not be stopped so easy. I could not get near him. He radiates with the power of Winter, a power not seen on Erebus for generations, and his army grows more numerous. It seems the endless winter is more likely than we thought."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Who is this Auric Ulvin?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Belthus, this is Decius of the Calabim. We were just discussing the future sovereignty of the Sidar in light of the Calabim's brutal conquest. Decius, we have our eye on more than just the nations nearest us. In the distant Aquillo Tundra occur events that could trouble us even here. Auric is a magical prodigy, and this power made him a suitable vessel for the machinations of the power of winter. Mulcarn was killed by the Godslayer, leaving his sphere without a suitable ruler. Auric has drawn together the tools of that god, and is preparing to become its avatar. Belthus was sent to stop him, but we acted too late. If the armies gathering against him do not stop him, he will return all Erebus to an Age of Winter."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Decius looked at the sword he held in his hands for a moment, then he sheathed it. "What if a god was not slain with the Godslayer, but trapped by the Nether Blade?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Sandalphon shrugged. "We have no experience with that."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Auric poses a grave threat. We will go to support those who stand against him, and if the Nether Blade staves off this threat for good, perhaps it can rid me of my troublesome allies as well."</German>
		<Italian>"This is but a room," the voice said, "And your entrance here means nothing. We will leave this place and find another."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"This isn't the first of your cities that have been conquered, shade. I will not give up until you yield. The world is not as big as it once was, when it emerged from winter wild and open. Places to hide are running out."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Sandalphon appeared behind him. "What do you want, Decius? A Sidar assassin to strike against your father in Torrolerial? He has his hands full with the Doviello invasion, I think. We could slay Varn Gosam in his sleep, if you still despise him, or free you from your obligations to Flauros while he feeds."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"You know so much about me? I think it is time for you to start answering my questions."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Giving answers isn't what we do. We watch and plan and wait and, if absolutely necessary, we act, without the world knowing we were here. To preserve the Sidar and our seclusion." Sandalphon faded from view again. Decius turned to Losha Valus, and gestured to the slain shades scattered around the Sidar throne room. Losha and the other vampires accompanying Decius raised them as skeletons.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Face me Sandalphon, or every Sidar man, woman, and child we have killed or will ever find will be raised as a skeleton and sent to hunt you down. Will you enjoy your long life being forever invisible?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"No!" Sandalphon's rage was the first emotion he had shown. "Leave them be. You have no right to abuse the dead. These bodies are all that remains in this world of our friends, and you have no right to enslave them. I will yield to you."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Decius nodded, and Losha released the bodies of the slain shades. "I want to know why you attacked me."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"The Calabim are an intriguing people, not unlike us until recently. You have led them to be more aggressive with your leadership, since you did not face the hardship that they saw during the Age of Winter. After your success in the war of Tempus Mor, we predicted a resurgent Calabim ruling over the entire world, and feasting on the Sidar. The risk of this outweighed the risk of revealing ourselves, and so we activated our assassins in the area. Unfortunately, only Rathus accomplished his goal."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"He was the one who struck at the Elohim, then? I have a friend who badly wants his sword." Decius pulled out the Nether Blade that they had taken from Rathus's corpse and examined it. Green runes pulsed along the light ebon blade. "What makes this sword special?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"The Nether Blade is an artifact from the underworld. Its power draws any it slays into Arawns lands and anchors them in his vault."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Hmm. I think this might be better than whatever Os-Gabella could offer me.

A Sidar assassin to strike against your father in Torrolerial? He has his hands full with the Doviello invasion, I think. Would you prefer we poison the Calabim lords? We prefer not to draw the attention of other immortals to ourselves; we are still new at this and they may know more than us."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"You know so much about me, do you? I think it is time for you to start answering my questions."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Giving answers isn't what we do. We watch and plan and wait and, if absolutely necessary, we act, without the world knowing we were here. To preserve the Sidar and our seclusion." Sandalphon faded from view again. Decius turned to Vaughn, and the Paladin brought forth a relic of Lugus, flooding the room with light, revealing Sandalphon sitting calmly on his throne. "You seem to have me at a disadvantage. What are your terms?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"I want to know why you attacked Ethne and me."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"You were both instrumental in leading the war in Tempus Mor, dangerously close to this secluded valley. And you were winning. Based on our observations of your actions in the desert of Myrh, we calculated that an empowered Overcouncil flush with victory would try to expand its position here, attempting to bring us under their 'enlightened' sovereignty. The risk of inaction seemed greater than the risk of action, so we activated our assassins in the region, to attempt to bring a stalemate to the battle and dissuade you from going further. Unfortunately, our plans failed, and here you are."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"This is what you do? You decide who lives and dies based on what you think that they will do?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Sandalphon sneered at Decius, the first hint of emotion that he displayed. "You are so much better? You are a ruler-you decide who lives and dies among the untold number that dwell within your borders. Among your soldiers you execute those who betray or desert you, and unleash them on those who would stand against you. You exercise the power of the judge over many, yet you take offense at we who dare to judge only a few, only the kings or priests or generals?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"You have no authority over me."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"We have the same authority over you that you have over your citizens-we have the power to act on our judgments."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Decius sighed. "I had come hoping to take you as my vassal, to use you against my enemies. I see now that that would be a foolish plan, only inviting my death or that of my heir. Here is what I propose instead. Give me an advisor. We will leave you to yourselves, to live your long, quiet, isolated lives, but send one of your number to sit in our councils, not as a member but to warn us before you strike. Why should my death be your first course of action?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Sandalphon considered him. "This is acceptable. Provided that you personally tell no one of our existence. You can work through your council to see that our few interests are maintained, and we shall likewise leave the world alone for as long as we think wise."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"There is one other condition. I want the soul of Ethne freed. She was slain and cannot be resurrected."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"The Elohim woman... Rathus took the Nether Blade when he attacked her, because she knows the secrets of the Mercurian Gate, passed down through the regents of the Elohim."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"There is no point it slaying her for that now; the secret has been used, and spread throughout the Empyrean to Bourne the Gleaming. Release her spirit."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"The Nether Blade is an artifact from the underworld. It will draw the soul of anyone it slays into Arawns realm and anchors them there. Destroying it should free those whose souls belong elsewhere. Free them to serve their true lord, be it in their vault or recalled to Erebus."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Then I shall do so, and free Ethne to return to her people." Decius pulled out the blade that they had taken from Rathus's corpse and studied it for a moment. Green runes pulsed along the light ebon blade.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Behind Sandalphon another Ghost appeared suddenly, drawing their attention. "Belthus, welcome back," Sandalphon said.

They have discovered us, but we have come to an understanding."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Varn Gosam met Auric Ulvin.

We prefer not to draw the attention of other immortals to ourselves; we are still new at this and they may know more than us."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"You know so much about me, do you? I think it is time for you to start answering my questions."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Giving answers isn't what we do. We watch and plan and wait and, if absolutely necessary, we act, without the world knowing we were here. To preserve the Sidar and our seclusion." Sandalphon faded from view again. Decius turned to Vaughn, and the Paladin brought forth a relic of Lugus, flooding the room with light, revealing Sandalphon sitting calmly on his throne. "You seem to have me at a disadvantage. What are your terms?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"I want to know why you attacked Ethne and me."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"You were both instrumental in leading the war in Tempus Mor, dangerously close to this secluded valley. And you were winning. Based on our observations of your actions in the desert of Myrh, we calculated that an empowered Overcouncil flush with victory would try to expand its position here, attempting to bring us under their 'enlightened' sovereignty. The risk of inaction seemed greater than the risk of action, so we activated our assassins in the region, to attempt to bring a stalemate to the battle and dissuade you from going further. Unfortunately, our plans failed, and here you are."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"This is what you do? You decide who lives and dies based on what you think that they will do?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Sandalphon sneered at Decius, the first hint of emotion that he displayed. "You are so much better? You are a ruler-you decide who lives and dies among the untold number that dwell within your borders. Among your soldiers you execute those who betray or desert you, and unleash them on those who would stand against you. You exercise the power of the judge over many, yet you take offense at we who dare to judge only a few, only the kings or priests or generals?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"You have no authority over me."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"We have the same authority over you that you have over your citizens-we have the power to act on our judgments."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Decius sighed. "I had come hoping to take you as my vassal, to use you against my enemies. I see now that that would be a foolish plan, only inviting my death or that of my heir. Here is what I propose instead. Give me an advisor. We will leave you to yourselves, to live your long, quiet, isolated lives, but send one of your number to sit in our councils, not as a member but to warn us before you strike. Why should my death be your first course of action?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Sandalphon considered him. "This is acceptable. Provided that you personally tell no one of our existence. You can work through your council to see that our few interests are maintained, and we shall likewise leave the world alone for as long as we think wise."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"There is one other condition. I want the soul of Ethne freed. She was slain and cannot be resurrected."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"The Elohim woman... Rathus took the Nether Blade when he attacked her, because she knows the secrets of the Mercurian Gate, passed down through the regents of the Elohim."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"There is no point it slaying her for that now; the secret has been used, and spread throughout the Empyrean to Bourne the Gleaming. Release her spirit."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"The Nether Blade is an artifact from the underworld. It will draw the soul of anyone it slays into Arawns realm and anchors them there. Destroying it should free those whose souls belong elsewhere. Free them to serve their true lord, be it in their vault or recalled to Erebus."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Then I shall do so, and free Ethne to return to her people." Decius pulled out the blade that they had taken from Rathus's corpse and studied it for a moment. Green runes pulsed along the light ebon blade.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Behind Sandalphon another Ghost appeared suddenly, drawing their attention. "Belthus, welcome back," Sandalphon said. "How went your mission?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Auric Ulvin's war will not be stopped so easy. I could not get near him. He radiates with the power of Winter, a power not seen on Erebus for generations, and his army grows more numerous. It seems the endless winter is more likely than we thought."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Auric Ulvin? I know that name..." said Decius.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Who is this?" asked Belthus.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Decius leads the Malakim army. They have discovered us, but we have come to an understanding."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Varn Gosam met Auric Ulvin. Varn gave up his vaunted position among a secluded elven tribe to free him, though it would have cost them both their lives had Auric's great power not manifested."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Auric is a magical prodigy, and this power made him a suitable vessel for the machinations of the power of winter. Mulcarn was killed by the Godslayer, leaving his sphere without a suitable ruler. Auric has drawn together the tools of that god, and is preparing to become its avatar. Belthus was sent to stop him, but we acted too late. If the armies gathering against him do not stop him, he will return all Erebus to an Age of Winter."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Decius looked at the sword he held in his hands for a moment, then he sheathed it. "What if a god was not slain with the Godslayer, but trapped by the Nether Blade?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Sandalphon shrugged. "We have no experience with that. I thought you intended to free your friend?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Auric poses a grave threat. We will go to support those who stand against him, and if the Nether Blade staves off this threat for good... I can only hope that Ethne forgives me."</Italian>

We will leave this place and find another."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"This isn't the first of your cities that have been conquered, shade. I will not give up until you yield. The world is not as big as it once was, when it emerged from winter wild and open. Places to hide are running out."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Sandalphon appeared behind him. "What do you want, Decius?

Whatever army had camped there was gone now.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"It's like chasing the wind," Lucian said in frustration, "what is the point of a mercenary army if you can never catch up with them long enough to hire them?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Is it possible they were defeated here; I heard they were involved in the war between the sandmen and the cabal."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Auric considered Riuros's suggestion, "Maybe. There must be survivors from one side or the other, send out the scouts and see if they can track some down. I want to talk to any Hippus they find, so make sure they aren't attacked."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]That last instruction was for Lucian; the Doviello scouts were excellent trackers but horrible diplomats.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A few days later they had three different reports from the scouts. One reported Hippus commanders in the Calabim city of Acaia gloating of their victory and the wisdom hiring them. Another reported disheveled Hippus units in the Malakim city of Bryn that spoke of a crushing loss on the plains. The last reported a significant Hippus army massed in a nearby valley, looking unbloodied and well rested.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]But when they arrived at the valley the Hippus were gone, as were any signs that they had been there. The scout stared dumbfounded at the empty valley and would have been beaten for leading the army to the empty valley if Riuros didn't spot a small band of riders under the Hippus flag heading toward them.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]There were four riders. Tasunke was as close as the Hippus had to a king, and his three captains let him do the talking. After introductions Tasunke asked if Auric wanted to hire the Hippus.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Yes," Auric answered, "the capture of Torrolerial and Midgar has deepened our treasury but shortened our time. I want to hire you to go to the Finnian Fields and recover an item from the Luchuirp, a golem named Barnaxus."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"How are we to know which golem is the right one? Battle doesn't often allow for the exchange of pleasantries."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Auric paused, then to the surprise of Lucian and the priests he ignored Tasunke's sarcasm and returned only a thin, insincere smile.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Barnaxus has the mark of the white hand upon him. Find the golem with that mark and bring him to me to earn your reward."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"That we can do." Tasunke replied, "But I will need money to finance the move of my army to the Finnian Fields. The Luchuirp aren't likely to give up their golem so easily."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Auric thought carefully before responding.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"I will pay for every enemy you kill upon the fields. Show dedication to your task and you will be able to bring your men. Relax in valley camps and pretend to fight wars and you will get no money from me."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"I am agreed.

Auric touched each piece carefully, as if they were religious artifacts.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Lucian stood near the door of the chamber, seeming the least confused by Auric's actions but only because he had given up trying to understand them. Dumannios, Riuros, and Anagantios all watched Auric carefully, sensing something deeply significant in the golem's shattered parts but unable to tell what. Tasunke just waited to get paid.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The room's only other occupant was caged. Beeri Bawl, Luchuirp king, sat ignobly in an old wolf pen that Tasunke had dragged along as a special present for Auric. Beeri was the most surprised to find that Barnaxus was not only the cause of the war with the Hippus, but of so much interest to the Illian priests.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"This is not a golem," Auric began, "he is not powered by gears and dwarven enchantment but by the divine breath of Mulcarn himself. This is the last piece of Mulcarn, that which was untouched by the Godslayer."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Oh yeah, that golem's a god. I got a pair of boots made out of Bhall's panties too if you're interested. They smell kinda funny but sure do keep your toes warm on a cold night."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Everyone but Auric glowered at Beeri, but he only crossed his arms and stared back at them.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Auric placed his hands on the chest of the broken golem and began chanting. The spell started low and quiet as he repeated each incantation. To Tasunke it sounded like a lullaby, but in a language he had never heard. It wasn't harsh or chaotic like the spells he was used to hearing.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]As Auric continued to cast the room chilled to the point where everyone's breath could be seen. Outside of Auric's spell the rest of the sound dimmed and Beeri yelled and thrashed against the bars of his cage, but it went unnoticed.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Barnaxus's chest began to glow. As everyone watched a white radiance spread along the broken pieces and then gathered in his chest before flaring in the symbol of a white hand. The flare was so bright everyone was momentarily blinded, but when they could see again the shadow of Mulcarn stood above the table.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Dumannios, Riuros, and Anagantios fell to their knees. Tasunke felt his knees wobble, as if subconsciously wanting to worship the figure before him, but he resisted.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Mulcarn wasn't there, he wasn't real. It was only a glimmer of his power like the glow of sunlight after it has passed beneath the mountains. But still there was godhood in that image. And in that moment, with Auric standing arms outstretched before the last remnant of Mulcarn's power he did look like a man ascending to heaven.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The light turned to pale mist and Auric breathed it in. His body strained against the energy that coursed through it, then faded leaving him triumphant and weary for the experience. The three priests continued praying, but did so now at Auric's feet.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Looking at Lucian Auric said, "See that the horse lord is paid well for his service."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Tasunke smiled, "and what of the dwarf I brought you?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Auric considered Beeri closely, "He's very funny. Sell him to Perpentach, I'm sure the Momus can use another jester."</English>

		<English>Auric spent days within his tent as the army waited. He wasn't planning or meeting with his captains, but possessed of a deep depression and sleeping.

We will enter and pull the archangel from the chamber, and then sacrifice him on the cathedral floor to power our ritual."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Illian captains' white skin paled even further; they were shocked beyond speech.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Lucian replied, "When you command it, the Doviello will be ready."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Auric nodded and Lucian returned to his men.

		<Spanish>Auric spent days within his tent as the army waited. He wasn't planning or meeting with his captains, but possessed of a deep depression and sleeping. No one was able to rouse him from his tent and those that tried were met either with anger or simply ignored. The aenemic Illian warriors feared upcoming battles and the Doviello complained that there wasn't battle enough.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Until the morning Auric walked out and viewed the milling troops. He was once again a god king and at his command the army rose up and was ready to march. He spoke of their upcoming victories, of the returning God of Winter, blood enough to satiate the savage Doviello and the glory of a world once again under the hand of the Illians. And the army cheered.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]This was his way, battling between inhuman passion and despair. Both emotions overwhelmed and drove him on.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Only the immortals can funnel the divine, if I mean to ascend it will be through their blood."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Lucian followed behind Auric and his captains. The captains asked questions, and Auric answered cryptically or not at all, they advised against direct attack on the civilized lands and Auric was disgusted with them. He finally turned at looked at the trailing Lucian.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"What of the Doviello, have you the courage to reclaim your place beside winter's throne?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"My men are ready," Lucian answered, "how would you like them deployed?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Auric smiled.

		<English>Lucian loosed his men to ravage Torrolerial. The battle had been hard fought and they had earned their reward. He followed Auric into the cathedral flanked by Illian captains who cut down the remaining priests defending the building.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The walls were covered in scenes of the Bannor's battles in hell. In each Sabathiel or Capria stood protectively over the loyal soldiers. In one a single Bannor soldier stood before a closing portal with a host of demons around him.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]At the center of cathedral was a chamber covered with the symbols of Junil. A door set with a blazing sword was the only way into the chamber and the laws to enter were inscribed on it. It claimed that the area beyond was between this world and heaven, that it was sanctified ground and that only the high priests could open or pass through the door.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Auric ignored the warnings and threw the door open. Lucian readied his axe; he didnt know what to expect from an archangel but his axe hadn't failed him yet.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]But the chamber beyond was empty. There was only dust inside, no one had entered the chamber for years.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Has Sabathiel fled?" one of the captains asked.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"No." Despite his frustration Auric smiled. "The priests have been lying to the people. They claim that their laws are passed down from the archangel that protected them in hell but he abandoned them long ago. But they continue to use his legend to control the Bannor. This lie has cost them their capital."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"And what of our ritual?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"It seems we have another debt to repay. Sabathiel is not the only archangel in Erebus-there is one within the Grigori lands as well."</English>

		<English>Midgar burned. The Grigori capital was a stark contrast to that of the Bannor. Where the Bannor had temples the Grigori have meeting halls. Where the Bannor had religious symbols the Grigori had graceful art. Most noticeably the architecture of Alexandria shared a common design of fortified buildings, flags and banners. The Grigori buildings were as dissimilar as the people who made them.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]But the tapestry of buildings was united by the palace at its center. There was nothing like it in the city and its beautiful black and copper parapets were a source of inspiration for all the citizens. A testament to what men could create. When he wasn't in his throne room Cassiel himself spent hours within the palace's towers, looking out over his city.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]No doubt Cassiel knew we were coming. Many had fled from the city before Auric's army arrived. Lucian assumed the palace would be as empty as Sabathiel's chamber within the cathedral. Auric was becoming more despondent as they marched toward the capital, and in the past few days even the news of their victories had gone unnoticed as he was retreating more and more into the grip of depression.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]But this morning he arose again reborn. And everyone scrambled to keep up with him as he marched through the capital toward the palace. Ignoring the orders to flee a few loyal craftsmen defended the palace, their love for their king overruling their fear of the invading armies. Their defense was short lived and Auric marched into the throne room.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Cassiel stood in the center of the chamber. He was tall, and perfectly formed, as if a sculptor had formed the ideal man out of marble. There was no doubt that he was an archangel and in his eyes you could see the wisdom gained in his immortal life, and the weight of its burden upon him.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"I worried that I would need to raze every Grigori city in Erebus before I would find you." Auric said.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Leave my children be, I am the one you want."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]With that Auric commanded the Illian captains forward and they bound the archangel with four massive iron manacles brought especially for the purpose. Cassiel's clothes were torn off and a team of men took each chain, two for his arms and two for his legs and pulled them taunt. Lifting Cassiel off the ground and stretching him out until he screamed.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Those screams echoed through the palace halls and out into the city. There was so much torment and pain in them that everyone paused, saddened by their sound. Where Doviello soldiers brutally beat the last of the city's defenders both stopped to listen to the cries. For the first time the Doviello questioned their battle, and the dying Grigori shared tears with their leader.[PARAGRAPH:1]"There is a rescue waiting for you" Auric taunted, "A god who may be willing to accept you back in his ara. Will you trade the ideology of three ages for a chance to retain your immortal soul? Are you willing to admit that you exist only to serve the gods? How do you feel about divine intervention now that it is the only thing that can save you?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Cassiel didn't reply except to scream louder as his shoulders were ripped from their sockets with a dull pop. His shoulders flushed deep purple with blood and his arms rotated without restriction, only held to his body by skin and a few remaining tendons.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Auric took out a copper dagger and held it over Cassiel's heart.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"And when you die what heaven will accept you? I suspect only Agares will accept one who has so openly defied the gods."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"You are a farmer's son," Cassiel replied with great strain, "a boy who loved reading and nature. This voice that drives is not you. It promises power but it will imprison you. You must give up this war or you will ruin many lives, including your own."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Auric ignored the warning and plunged the dagger into Cassiel's heart. The archangel's scream echoed throughout the capital. The men holding the chains continued pulling in those last few seconds until Cassiel died and then they let his body drop onto the floor.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Everyone except Auric waited to see if Cassiel would be reborn, but he didn't move. Auric was finishing the ritual with the bloodied dagger. Slowly, carefully, he completed the spell by pushing the daggers blade into his right hand, cutting his flesh and allowing his blood to mix with the dead archangel.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In that moment, in a thousand different places in Erebus prophets received visions of a white dragon swallowing the world. Priests were overcome with a sense of foreboding and a cool wind blew through even the warmest areas. Auric's ascension had begun.</English>

How do you feel about divine intervention now that it is the only thing that can save you?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Cassiel didn't reply except to scream louder as his shoulders were ripped from their sockets with a dull pop. His shoulders flushed deep purple with blood and his arms rotated without restriction, only held to his body by skin and a few remaining tendons.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Auric took out a copper dagger and held it over Cassiel's heart.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"And when you die what heaven will accept you? I suspect only Agares will accept one who has so openly defied the gods."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"You are a farmer's son," Cassiel replied with great strain, "a boy who loved reading and nature. This voice that drives is not you. It promises power but it will imprison you. You must give up this war or you will ruin many lives, including your own."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Auric ignored the warning and plunged the dagger into Cassiel's heart. The archangel's scream echoed throughout the capital. The men holding the chains continued pulling in those last few seconds until Cassiel died and then they let his body drop onto the floor.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Everyone except Auric waited to see if Cassiel would be reborn, but he didn't move. Auric was finishing the ritual with the bloodied dagger. Slowly, carefully, he completed the spell by pushing the daggers blade into his right hand, cutting his flesh and allowing his blood to mix with the dead archangel.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In that moment, in a thousand different places in Erebus prophets received visions of a white dragon swallowing the world. Priests were overcome with a sense of foreboding and a cool wind blew through even the warmest areas. Auric's ascension had begun.</Spanish>

"Nein, es ist weder eine Degradierung noch meine Entscheidung. Der Seher sagt es ist von großer Wichtigkeit das Ihr dies tut, wenn nicht das ganze Imperium gefährdet sein soll. So gehet und meldet euch bei Eurem Vater." Daraufhin ging Decius Vorräte sammeln und war innerhalb einer Stunde auf dem Weg heimwärts.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Decius betrat den Besprechungssaal der Festung vom Haus Achare. "Ich bin hier, Kommandant, doch weis ich nicht wieso.

Du hast etwas Anerkennung erlangt und ich würde Dir gern Dein Kommando geben. Aber Du hast Recht das ich Dich bis zum Ende ihrer Kampagne bei Lady Capria gelassen hätte, wenn ich könnte. Auch wenn die Seher so mitteilsam wie immer sind, so müssen sie doch erhört werden, und übernatürliche Bedrohungen in der Region machen ihnen Sorgen. Da Dein Bruder nach Süden gesendet wurde um Labscrum zu verstärken brauchte ich einen Kommandanten dem ich die Truppen des Hauses Achare anvertrauen konnte. Ich gebe Dir das Kommando unserer Expeditionstruppe; leider wirst Du einen 'Berater' benötigen."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Ich danke Dir für dein Vertrauen, Vater, ich werde Dich stolz machen."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Wie die Priester immer sagen, erst zu Gott, dann zum König und dann zu Eurem Kommandanten.

Most died, but the few that passed the trials went on to be some of the most powerful archmages of their age.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Some or the leaders in the current age, such as Os-Gabella and Perpentach, went through these trials when Patria was still the only empire of man. Others, such as Laroth, Barbatos or Trenton Majosi are less well known survivors of the trials.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It was hundreds of years into the Age of Rebirth before Dain of the Amurites, discovered the records of these magical trials. They were considered archaic, a violent reminder of Patria during its darkest hours. The culture of the Amurites celebrated public study of magic and this was seen as a more enlightened approach.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]But Dain wondered how he compared to the Patrian archmages. And was even more interested in the greater talent the trial seemed to imbue in the lucky few who survived. Dain searched for, and found several locations for these trials, but most were simply empty towers, dungeons or cave labyrinths. Until in the year 441 of the fourth age Dain found the location of one that was still active.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The locals, a group of Balseraph fishermen living on the edge of their empire, long ago learned to avoid the cave; no one who entered it ever came out. They claimed death himself lived within it. They also claimed that chickens were divine, so Dain didnt take their warnings very seriously.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]With a spellstaff and healing salve ready, as these were the traditional aides given to those taking the trial, Dain entered the cave.</English>

		<English>"Falamar..." Chaeli whispered.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]He pushed her against one of the massive crates that littered the docks of Dunwich. The moon was well past its zenith and the narrow gap between two crates where they found themselves was hidden in shadows. It was a beautiful night, but the stink of the docks hung thick in the air.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]She leaned back as his kisses wandered down her neck to her very ample bosom. Only stopping when she playfully pulled his hands away when they reached inside her bodice.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Ain't ya ever wanted to be with the legendary Falamar?" he asked and she smiled radiantly, letting him grope her until he began pulling up on her dress.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"No, no," she said, "just kiss me."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]There was a second of anger in his eyes, even in her drunken haze Chaeli recognized it, she had seen it before from other men and it never ended well.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]He kissed her again, raising her hands above her head where he held both with one of his hands. He held them so tightly they felt like they were manacled to the wall. His other hand reached down and pulled up her dress, tearing it aside and reaching hungrily into it.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"No, Falamar," she yelled. Then when he wouldn't stop she bit his cheek.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]He let go of his dress and punched her full in the face, her head crunched against the wooden crate and seagulls along the dock yelled in complaint and took to flight. She started crying as he reached again for her dress.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Did someone call me?" A man standing a the edge of the crates asked.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The attacker, the man pretending to be Falamar, quickly let go of Chaeli and stepped away from the speaker. The speaker was a thin handsome man, lean and confident though he looked dangerous now, like a coiled snake. Though Chaeli felt unthreatened by him, her attacker felt differently and he immediately let go of Chaeli.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Captain Falamar," he stammered.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Issac?" Falamar answered, "I was sure I heard my name."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Falamar, the real Falamar, kept advancing into the makeshift alley between the crates and Issac kept backing up. When Falamar reached Chaeli he asked her, "Are you okay?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]She nodded and tried to wipe the tears from her eyes. She could already feel her face bruising up from the punch.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"I'm sorry Falamar," Issac said, "sometimes I tell the gullie's I'm you. Just a bit of wishful dreaming I suppose."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"That is not the crime I am concerned about." Falamar answered. Then Falamar struck, jumping forward he caught the larger man by the collar and slammed him back against the crates. Issac drew his knife but Falamar knocked it easily aside. With Issac trapped against the crate Falamar punched him, splintering Issac's cheekbone so severely it left his left eye rolling loosely in its socket and his cheek ran flush with purple blood.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Go or I will give my sword to the lady and she will act out her desires on you, as you had intended for her."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Issac scrambled away.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Chaeli, stunned into silence until this moment, fell suddenly into uncontrollable tears. Falamar tilted up her face, checking her bruise and as her sobs quieted her gave her a slight smile.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Can I walk you home?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Chaeli only nodded in response. They walked in silence through the empty streets. Despite the trauma it was still a beautiful night and as they approached the squat flat Chaeli shared with her family she finally spoke.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"I thought... he said he was you."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Falamar waited until they stood before her door before he answered.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"You deserve better than the Dunwich docks. Expect more from men, no matter their name."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]She nodded, not really understanding.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Will you be okay?" Falamar asked.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Yes, my father is home. I will be okay, thanks to you."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Falamar gave her another slight smile, said good night and headed back toward the docks. They were supposed to have set sail hours ago but Falamar was late as usual. He arrived to find the ship and the crew ready. Several men traded knowing glances as he came aboard.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"What was her name this time captain?" one called.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"I didn't ask." Falamar responded.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]His men laughed and cheered, they all assumed incorrectly but it boosted their spirits and Falamar saw little harm in it. The legend was certainly greater than the man, but when you regularly asked your men to face death sometimes it was easier if they believed a legend led them.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Amergin, Falamar's first mate, had already loaded the supplies and made sure the crew was on board and relatively sober. He had questions but had been serving Falamar since they were both boys, so he knew he would get the answers when Falamar was ready.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Yes Amergin, we will be sailing out by moonlight. I have a contract from a Balseraph princess and it seems we need to make up some time. She pays well, and needs us to trap some animals for her."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Its an unusual task for you," Amergin commented.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Easy gold and a damsel who needs help. It sounds exactly like me."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Amergin smiled and ordered the crew to lift the anchor and set sail. Within seconds the ship was off to the Aegis Isles.</English>

It was a beautiful night, but the stink of the docks hung thick in the air.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]She leaned back as his kisses wandered down her neck to her very ample bosom. Only stopping when she playfully pulled his hands away when they reached inside her bodice.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Ain't ya ever wanted to be with the legendary Falamar?" he asked and she smiled radiantly, letting him grope her until he began pulling up on her dress.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"No, no," she said, "just kiss me."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]There was a second of anger in his eyes, even in her drunken haze Chaeli recognized it, she had seen it before from other men and it never ended well.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]He kissed her again, raising her hands above her head where he held both with one of his hands. He held them so tightly they felt like they were manacled to the wall. His other hand reached down and pulled up her dress, tearing it aside and reaching hungrily into it.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"No, Falamar," she yelled. Then when he wouldn't stop she bit his cheek.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]He let go of his dress and punched her full in the face, her head crunched against the wooden crate and seagulls along the dock yelled in complaint and took to flight. She started crying as he reached again for her dress.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Did someone call me?" A man standing a the edge of the crates asked.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The attacker, the man pretending to be Falamar, quickly let go of Chaeli and stepped away from the speaker. The speaker was a thin handsome man, lean and confident though he looked dangerous now, like a coiled snake. Though Chaeli felt unthreatened by him, her attacker felt differently and he immediately let go of Chaeli.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Captain Falamar," he stammered.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Issac?" Falamar answered, "I was sure I heard my name."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Falamar, the real Falamar, kept advancing into the makeshift alley between the crates and Issac kept backing up. When Falamar reached Chaeli he asked her, "Are you okay?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]She nodded and tried to wipe the tears from her eyes. She could already feel her face bruising up from the punch.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"I'm sorry Falamar," Issac said, "sometimes I tell the gullie's I'm you. Just a bit of wishful dreaming I suppose."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"That is not the crime I am concerned about." Falamar answered. Then Falamar struck, jumping forward he caught the larger man by the collar and slammed him back against the crates. Issac drew his knife but Falamar knocked it easily aside. With Issac trapped against the crate Falamar punched him, splintering Issac's cheekbone so severely it left his left eye rolling loosely in its socket and his cheek ran flush with purple blood.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Go or I will give my sword to the lady and she will act out her desires on you, as you had intended for her."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Issac scrambled away.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Chaeli, stunned into silence until this moment, fell suddenly into uncontrollable tears. Falamar tilted up her face, checking her bruise and as her sobs quieted her gave her a slight smile.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Can I walk you home?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Chaeli only nodded in response. They walked in silence through the empty streets. Despite the trauma it was still a beautiful night and as they approached the squat flat Chaeli shared with her family she finally spoke.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"I thought... he said he was you."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Falamar waited until they stood before her door before he answered.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"You deserve better than the Dunwich docks. Expect more from men, no matter their name."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]She nodded, not really understanding.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Will you be okay?" Falamar asked.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Yes, my father is home. I will be okay, thanks to you."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Falamar gave her another slight smile, said good night and headed back toward the docks. They were supposed to have set sail hours ago but Falamar was late as usual. He arrived to find the ship and the crew ready. Several men traded knowing glances as he came aboard.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"What was her name this time captain?" one called.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"I didn't ask." Falamar responded.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]His men laughed and cheered, they all assumed incorrectly but it boosted their spirits and Falamar saw little harm in it. The legend was certainly greater than the man, but when you regularly asked your men to face death sometimes it was easier if they believed a legend led them.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Amergin, Falamar's first mate, had already loaded the supplies and made sure the crew was on board and relatively sober. He had questions but had been serving Falamar since they were both boys, so he knew he would get the answers when Falamar was ready.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Yes Amergin, we will be sailing out by moonlight. I have a contract from a Balseraph princess and it seems we need to make up some time. She pays well, and needs us to trap some animals for her."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Its an unusual task for you," Amergin commented.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Easy gold and a damsel who needs help. It sounds exactly like me."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Amergin smiled and ordered the crew to lift the anchor and set sail. Within seconds the ship was off to the Aegis Isles.</German>

		<English>She was a delightful, if not demented, child and she twirled and danced between the animals we had assembled for her. Her courtier counted out the gold we had been promised and excused her behavior, though it was his disdain for her that bothered me far more than the young princess's enthusiasm.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]After checking each animal Keelyn approached me. She had a griffon feather in her hair and her dress, though once beautiful, was now patched and worn as if unable to keep up with the tiny tornado.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"These must be the most excellent animals from anywhere on Erebus!"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I smiled, "I am pleased that you think so, my hunters searched every corner of this island to find them for you. Where other princesses have rooms of toy animals, you will have the real things."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]She grinned. This was my plan, to keep her focused on how wonderful it was. Her mind didn't dwell long on achievements and she was usually racing off to the next goal, and I had tired of searching this island for whatever she wanted next. But it was too late, her smile faded and her brow furrowed in thought. She was going to ask for more.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"It is a wonderful collection, but what about those that don't live on the island? What about those in the sea? The Lanun are talented fishermen, right?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"The best," I answered, at least this was the sort of hunting my men would prefer, "would you like us to gather some giant crabs, otolochs, or tortoises for you?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]She seemed to consider the suggestion, "No" she said, "do you know the giant wiggly beasts that are painted on the walls of the temple in Shaol?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Yes, squids. They wouldn't survive long in your zoo I'm afraid. They had to stay in the water."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Keelyn nodded, "Bring me some and I'll have Chuckles close in the harbor so they can't run away."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Occasionally we caught squid in our nets, from those as long as a man's arm to those twice as long as a man. It wouldn't be much trouble to snare a few for her.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Of course," I said loud enough for her snobbish courtier to hear, "we would be happy to capture a few squid for your collection, for the same price as the others."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The courtier sighed and looked as disappointed as Keelyn was excited.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Load up the ships," I called to the men, "we do the rest of our hunting from beneath the white and purple, and atop a hull full of rum."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]My men cheered and a few hours later we set out from the docks with a fair wind and high spirits.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I dropped into darkness. I could hear the explosion of splintering wood and sense the movement of a giant around me. Something so great even the whales feared it. The central mast broke and plunged past me through the water. This was the only indication I had of direction, and I began swimming desperately toward the direction the mast came from.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The seas were rough, but the Lanun like to say that just requires more drink to steady the ship. Though it was the perfect area for fishing our nets came up empty on every pull. We were preparing to move back towards the coast when the creatures attacked.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Giant tentacles reached up over the deck and crushed the ships as if they were made of paper. There was no coherent defense against this attack and the screaming of my men disappeared as the sea claimed me.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Just as I saw the shimmer of light through the inky darkness, as my lungs burned for air, I felt the tip of a tentacle close around my leg. I reached for my sword, but the sheath was empty. I had lost it in the water. A tug pulled me down, away from that golden halo of light and I fought for any way out of its grip.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]There was a single glint of metal in the darkness. It floated down from the remains of the ship and I reached to catch it. It was beyond my reach so I twisted against the tentacle, buying myself a precious few inches and I closed my hand around it. I immediately twisted back into the tentacle bringing the weapon to cut it from my leg. Only to discover that I only held a silver candlestick. In that moment my lungs exploded and I drank in the sea. All else disappeared.</English>

Her mind didn't dwell long on achievements and she was usually racing off to the next goal, and I had tired of searching this island for whatever she wanted next. But it was too late, her smile faded and her brow furrowed in thought. She was going to ask for more.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"It is a wonderful collection, but what about those that don't live on the island? What about those in the sea? The Lanun are talented fishermen, right?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"The best," I answered, at least this was the sort of hunting my men would prefer, "would you like us to gather some giant crabs, otolochs, or tortoises for you?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]She seemed to consider the suggestion, "No" she said, "do you know the giant wiggly beasts that are painted on the walls of the temple in Shaol?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Yes, squids. They wouldn't survive long in your zoo I'm afraid. They had to stay in the water."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Keelyn nodded, "Bring me some and I'll have Chuckles close in the harbor so they can't run away."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Occasionally we caught squid in our nets, from those as long as a man's arm to those twice as long as a man. It wouldn't be much trouble to snare a few for her.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Of course," I said loud enough for her snobbish courtier to hear, "we would be happy to capture a few squid for your collection, for the same price as the others."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The courtier sighed and looked as disappointed as Keelyn was excited.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Load up the ships," I called to the men, "we do the rest of our hunting from beneath the white and purple, and atop a hull full of rum."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]My men cheered and a few hours later we set out from the docks with a fair wind and high spirits.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I dropped into darkness. I could hear the explosion of splintering wood and sense the movement of a giant around me. Something so great even the whales feared it. The central mast broke and plunged past me through the water. This was the only indication I had of direction, and I began swimming desperately toward the direction the mast came from.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The seas were rough, but the Lanun like to say that just requires more drink to steady the ship. Though it was the perfect area for fishing our nets came up empty on every pull. We were preparing to move back towards the coast when the creatures attacked.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Giant tentacles reached up over the deck and crushed the ships as if they were made of paper. There was no coherent defense against this attack and the screaming of my men disappeared as the sea claimed me.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Just as I saw the shimmer of light through the inky darkness, as my lungs burned for air, I felt the tip of a tentacle close around my leg. I reached for my sword, but the sheath was empty. I had lost it in the water. A tug pulled me down, away from that golden halo of light and I fought for any way out of its grip.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]There was a single glint of metal in the darkness. It floated down from the remains of the ship and I reached to catch it. It was beyond my reach so I twisted against the tentacle, buying myself a precious few inches and I closed my hand around it. I immediately twisted back into the tentacle bringing the weapon to cut it from my leg. Only to discover that I only held a silver candlestick. In that moment my lungs exploded and I drank in the sea. All else disappeared.</Italian>
		<Spanish>She was a delightful, if not demented, child and she twirled and danced between the animals we had assembled for her. Her courtier counted out the gold we had been promised and excused her behavior, though it was his disdain for her that bothered me far more than the young princess's enthusiasm.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]After checking each animal Keelyn approached me. She had a griffon feather in her hair and her dress, though once beautiful, was now patched and worn as if unable to keep up with the tiny tornado.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"These must be the most excellent animals from anywhere on Erebus!"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I smiled, "I am pleased that you think so, my hunters searched every corner of this island to find them for you.

This Empyrean religion is only gaining followers. It is time to be more aggressive."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"We have discussed why that is not among your options."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"This Varn Gosam has called a meeting of tribal leaders. My spies tell me they are leaning toward uniting with him. Your foes will hold much more power in this region unless we act to stop them. I will take your army to the Malakim capital and burn it to the ground. That should keep the sand rats in their place."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"You will act within the limits I have set for you. Or I will tear you to shreds."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Decius raised blade. "Can you do so before I get in a single hit?" Flauros laughed, drawing his own blade, but Decius continued, "Because the Council's assassins have shown me a few things. Such as a rare desert plant, the extracts of which can cause a man pain like he's never known for as long as he lives. Perhaps you are willing to chance that over the course of your very long life you can find an antidote. Or that the effects will wear off after only a few hundred years. But why not chance that your power can be used beyond playing shepherd to a broken people, can rather shape the world stage to our benefit?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Flauros stood a moment, gazing at Decius. Then he sheathed his blade. "My sister would have killed you, and lived with the pain. Very well, take what you need. Raze every city with the Empyrean. If you bring calamity upon us, I will survive, and you will not, no matter the trump you hold. If your gamble succeeds, you will have a place among us forever."</English>

		<English>The primitive encampment of the Hill Giants is razed, and the Giants themselves feeding the vultures. In one hut dwell a score of human slaves, their eyes lighting up at the sight of the destruction of their captors. One young man in tattered yellow clothes approaches Decius. "In the name of Lugus the Light, I thank you sir."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Who is this Lugus? Your feudal lord?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Nay, good sir, he is the god of light, whose wisdom enlightens all the peoples of this desert."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Decius yanks the mans chains, pulling him to his knees. "Not wise enough to keep you safe, nor alert you when you speak to a foe." [NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Flauros is pleased to see that Decius has the mettle he suspected. Less so to hear of the Ecclesiastic. "I have not seen a priest of Lugus for over six hundred years, and now one appears on my borders? This is an ill sign."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Decius raises an eyebrow. "Six hundred years? The Prelates spoke of devil-men living in the desert of Myrh. I hadn't expected they were being quite so literal."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"I have no allegiance to Hell, simply similar tactics-extracting power from mortals. I trust this doesn't strain our working arrangement?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Decius shrugged. "I've little illusions about how you treat your subjects. What you do with their souls is even less my concern. I've passed your test. What is next?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"The Bannor were fools to discard such a useful tool as you. Efficient and heartless. But I need guile as well. Lugus is an old foe, and not one to release a grudge. His cult gaining ground here means trouble for us. I need you to strike down these Ecclesiastics, without drawing us into direct confrontation with the desert tribes."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"I've seen your power. Give me command of a larger force of vampires and we can be ruling this entire desert."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"I have shared our secret with you, Decius, but wish it to remain that. If we take ourselves into the battlefield, we will be hunted down by all the nations. Better to stay on the edges of the civilized world. Lugus has other enemies that may aid us, however, without asking questions. Let us encourage the Council of Esus among our lands, and train men who can strike without revealing their masters. Use them to eliminate the disciples of Lugus, and the power I wield may be yours."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Very well, we will do this your way, Flauros."</English>

		<English>Decius has fled the Bannor, seeking refuge across the sea. In the desert of Myrh dwell the Malakim, a morally upright people. He has had his fill of moral presumption, however, and seeks shelter amongst a more ethically flexible culture.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Calabim are an ancient order whose aristocracy prey on the weak of their society. Weakness has long since been drilled out of Decius.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It is a blighted neighborhood on the outskirts of Prespur over which Decius has exerted influence. Between the battered humans who have had their wills broken and those petty thugs just strong enough to prey on them, he has no competition for the petty fiefdom he sets up, so long as the aristocrats do not deign to enter.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Flauros, second born of all vampires, has seen this play out many times before. It is a replay of the Calabim social structure on a smaller scale, and he delights in letting the local lord know who is really on top.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Decius knows he is playing a dangerous game. When the bloodpets of the Vampiric lord come, his army is alert and dispatches them promptly. Flauros himself, however, is harder to handle. He personally slays Decius's army of exiles and criminals, leaving the bodies for the Moroi. Decius himself is far too interesting to do in, however.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"We have few immigrants here, and fewer still with your skills. Why do you come to our land, only to wallow in the filth of the livestock?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Decius folds his arms. "I kept every code and rule of my home, only to have them turn me out. I am through with rules and submission to authority. I will rise to the top, or die on my feet."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Flauros smiled. "Whether you know it or not, you have come to the right place then. Our nation is a meritocracy in ways the Bannor would never hope to emulate. Those undeserving are consumed, while those who prove themselves are rewarded beyond their keen. I offer you a chance to start down this path. I will give you command of a small force. Eliminate the Hill Giants that have been preying on our countryside."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Decius nodded. "Very well. But with the rabble you call soldiers, I don't give good odds of my survival."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Either way it will be entertaining."</English>

		<English>Varn was a difficult man to find in the weeks after his revelations. Decius came upon him sending out a group of messengers, and he turned to Decius to explain, "We can no longer tarry with the tribes of this desert. I will call a council meeting. A desert custom I hope to incorporate into the Overcouncil. Those that adopted our faith will join with us, but I fear we will alienate those that did not. Either way, your task has not changed, just expanded. You need to spread this faith throughout the region. It must become the dominant creed here for our alliance to last. Beware the Calabim, for they will surely continue to oppose us."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Varn turned to go, anxious to oversee some Vicar's training, or perhaps give guidance to a caravanner. Decius stopped him with a hand on his shoulder. "I am not sure I like this goal, Varn. My people were united by the Order of Junil, it is true, but I now see that their zeal was not without a grave price, a price I do not wish to extract in pursuit of your cause either."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Varn smiled. "The tactics are up to you, Decius. We need not seek destruction of the Calabim, wicked as they may be, if our missionaries are able in their persuasion, and likewise you can try to avoid bringing harm to those of the desert that oppose us. But the desert is a harsh place, and I need a man of steel like you that I can depend on. For your tactical mind, and for a friend who will voice his concerns should our task overwhelm my judgment. With haste, perhaps a band of Ecclesiastics will be enough. If not, the Vicars will be able to drive out competing creeds in our allied towns. Force is an allowable last resort, I'm afraid."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Decius nodded and let Varn leave.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"At least you got to speak to him today." Decius turned to see Talia, the beautiful woman who had first given him a role in the Malakim-and Varn Gosam's wife.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"My lady."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Always with his priests these days. His work is a noble mission, but I confess I was happier before Lugus's worship was so codified, and my wisdom was sought as well. By day he is in meeting after meeting, training missionaries and scribes and hearing disputes among his faithful, clarifying dogma. And by night... well I am ready for him, but he is so exhausted!"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"I will speak to him of your concerns, then," Decius said, stepping back.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Thank you, Decius. You are a good friend, and like the Varn I love in so many ways." She gave him a kiss on each cheek before leaving him to his duty; a custom in the desert, though not a common one in this day. Decius steeled himself to his task. He had known countless women widowed by war, women with complaints that dwarfed Talia's, but her loneliness was genuine. The Varn she had pledged to was not the one so consumed with his goals... but such is life.</English>

And by night... well I am ready for him, but he is so exhausted!"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"I will speak to him of your concerns, then," Decius said, stepping back.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Thank you, Decius. You are a good friend, and like the Varn I love in so many ways." She gave him a kiss on each cheek before leaving him to his duty; a custom in the desert, though not a common one in this day. Decius steeled himself to his task. He had known countless women widowed by war, women with complaints that dwarfed Talia's, but her loneliness was genuine. The Varn she had pledged to was not the one so consumed with his goals... but such is life.</Italian>
		<Spanish>Varn was a difficult man to find in the weeks after his revelations. Decius came upon him sending out a group of messengers, and he turned to Decius to explain, "We can no longer tarry with the tribes of this desert. I will call a council meeting. A desert custom I hope to incorporate into the Overcouncil. Those that adopted our faith will join with us, but I fear we will alienate those that did not. Either way, your task has not changed, just expanded. You need to spread this faith throughout the region. It must become the dominant creed here for our alliance to last. Beware the Calabim, for they will surely continue to oppose us."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Varn turned to go, anxious to oversee some Vicar's training, or perhaps give guidance to a caravanner. Decius stopped him with a hand on his shoulder. "I am not sure I like this goal, Varn. My people were united by the Order of Junil, it is true, but I now see that their zeal was not without a grave price, a price I do not wish to extract in pursuit of your cause either."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Varn smiled. "The tactics are up to you, Decius. We need not seek destruction of the Calabim, wicked as they may be, if our missionaries are able in their persuasion, and likewise you can try to avoid bringing harm to those of the desert that oppose us. But the desert is a harsh place, and I need a man of steel like you that I can depend on. For your tactical mind, and for a friend who will voice his concerns should our task overwhelm my judgment. With haste, perhaps a band of Ecclesiastics will be enough. If not, the Vicars will be able to drive out competing creeds in our allied towns. Force is an allowable last resort, I'm afraid."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Decius nodded and let Varn leave.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"At least you got to speak to him today." Decius turned to see Talia, the beautiful woman who had first given him a role in the Malakim-and Varn Gosam's wife.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"My lady."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Always with his priests these days. His work is a noble mission, but I confess I was happier before Lugus's worship was so codified, and my wisdom was sought as well. By day he is in meeting after meeting, training missionaries and scribes and hearing disputes among his faithful, clarifying dogma. And by night... well I am ready for him, but he is so exhausted!"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"I will speak to him of your concerns, then," Decius said, stepping back.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Thank you, Decius.

		<English>Decius has fled his homeland after being charged with witchcraft and conjuring demons. He seeks to preserve his values and find a new beginning among the Malakim, across the seas in the desert of Myrh. This ancient tribal people is coalescing around an unlikely new spiritual leader-the elf Varn Gosam, a refugee from an isolated elven community.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Malakim have taken in Decius and his entourage; hospitality in the desert is an iron law. He has yet to see meet his host, however.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]While watching the young soldiers drill in the evening Decius is approached by a raven-haired woman flanked by a sand lion cub. Flowing robes keep the sun off her skin but do nothing to hide her figure as the wind blows them taut against her. "Welcome, stranger. You have the look of one who well knows the art these boys struggle to master."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"I was a soldier of some renown, milady, and a commander for a season. I felled my people's enemies, until I was deemed one."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Strong and wise, and bereft of your heritage, like our Varn. We could make use of your skills, in exchange for a place of refuge."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"A gracious offer, milady. Have you the authority to make it?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"It is not authority I wield here, just influence, but I suspect it will be enough. More so if you could perform one task for us now. Varn Gosam has been gone for some time on pilgrimage, too long I fear. Lead a party to find him, east at the Mirror of Heaven, and you will have proven your worth and earned your place."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Decius rises with a nod. "I shall do so then. Who shall I say has commissioned this search?'[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The lady smiles. "My name is Talia."</English>

		<English>The windswept dunes change gradually as Decius nears the holy site of the Malakim. Travel across the flat glass field is treacherous, but in the center, near a crystal clear pool is Varn Gosam. Amidst a warm glow, he stands and greets the stern man leading the Malakim soldiers.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"You must be Decius. I came here to seek further guidance from Lugus the Light, who led me from the Shadowed Vale in preparation for some task. It is good to see that the Malakim have taken you in, as they have me. They are a hospitable people, with a destiny far beyond the dunes. I have no doubt you can find your purpose among them."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Decius turned his eyes from the glowing water. "The Bannor's priesthood gave me a clear purpose as well, to fight evil and stamp out heresy. I served them well and was betrayed. I think for a time I am content with aimlessness."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Varn smiled. "This is a new day for you, Decius. Dawn comes, and it is no time for slumber. For any who love good and freedom, for Lugus has shown me a vision of evil stirring in a far-off land. We must prepare, must bind together all good peoples in one council house before it is too late. Will you help me spread this vision? First to our brethren tribes in this desert, and beyond, to the peoples of the Elohim, the Kuriotates, the Khazad, the Ljosalfar-and perhaps even to the Bannor as well?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"I cannot turn on my ideals. If it is as you say, I will serve you and your cause, Gosam. Even if it means facing those who wrongly seek my head."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"And in return, you will never need do so alone. This is the message of the Empyrean." Varn Gosam loaded his belongings-incense, a water skin, a light tent, a pouch of salted meat-onto his camel. His tone changed as he and Decius headed back towards the awaiting Malakim party. "Lugus spoke to me of one other thing, Decius. The people to our East have a dread secret, and an ancient grudge with our good god. As we seek to spread our faith, I fear they will be an implacable foe, opposing us with sword and spell."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"This kind of opposition I am well suited for dealing with, Varn. Prepare your teachers, and I will guard them with our soldiers."</English>

Aber diese "Götter" forderten Opfergaben von ihren Gläubigen, die oft kostspieliger als die Kälte waren.</German>

		<English>The Balseraphs stared at the distant city of Dis, more terrifying than anything even their fertile imaginations could have created. The pass is covered in dark monuments to Hyborem's countless achievements. The corpses of his foes are built into these monuments or scattered across the wastes as a warning to any who would seek to defeat him. The stenches of sulfur and rotting flesh mingle together, making the foulest slums of Jubilee seem like a paradise. And the dread metropolis of Dis itself rises above it all. None of the Balseraphs dare imagine how many damned souls toil in that wretched city, or how many of them are armed and ready to defend it, rather than risk displeasing their dread masters.[PARAGRAPH:1]"It smells funny," Keelyn says, "but it could be pretty with a new coat of paint. I'm thinking pink. Everything looks nicer in pink."</English>

		<German>Die Balseraph starrten auf die ferne Stadt Dis, die Furcht einflößender war, als sie es sich selbst mit ihrer lebhaften Vorstellungskraft hätten ausmalen können. Der Pass ist gespickt mit dunklen Monumenten für Hyborems zahllosen Taten. Die Leichen seiner Feinde sind in diese Monumente eingelassen oder über die Einöde verstreut, als Warnung für jene, die versuchen sollten, ihn zu besiegen. Der Gestank von Schwefel und verrotendem Fleisch vermischen sich und lassen den dreckigsten Slum von Jubilee wie ein Paradies erscheinen. Und die grauenvolle Metropole Dis selbst thront über allem. Keiner der Balseraph wagt sich auch nur vorzustellen, wieviele verdammte Seelen in dieser elenden Stadt gequält werden, oder wieviele davon bewaffnet und lieber bereit sind, sie zu verteidigen, als die Verärgerung ihrer Meister zu riskieren.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Es riecht komisch", sagt Keelyn, "aber es könnte mit einem neuen Anstrich ganz hübsch sein. Ich denke an Rosa. Alles sieht in Rosa schöner aus."</German>

They threw themselves fully into battle and marched unquestioning into the Fane of Lessers. Death in righteous battle was their hope. There was no such thing as an old Mercurian soldier.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The angels were more somber. The Seraphim with their blazing swords kept careful watch for more dangers, the Ophanim floated above the broken fields for the first time riding unhindered within the Fane and the Valkyries tended to the dead.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Basium stood before the Throne of Hell, a vast gaping hole in Erebus. The ground around it bled a thick, dark ichor. It was a physical wound in this world, fully contaminated and defiled. Through it hell could be seen, a vast mountain sloping ever down to dark swamps. Somewhere beyond that swamp Basium knew the foul city of Mammon sat. It was the first step in turning the souls of men into demons.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Basium raised his club, within it demons howled in pain and torment, for it wouldnt let any demon it killed return to their immortal realms. Two Seraphim settled beside the portal, swords drawn.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Factum est." the Seraphim intoned.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Not yet" Basium replied, "our battle is not done. If we mean to truly defeat the Infernal we must tear down the city of Mammon, march across the fields of Camulos and destroy the temples of Aeron. Then we will rouse Agares himself, send an army into the dust sea and remove him from his dominion."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]With that Basium marched through the gate and his army marched unquestioningly after him.

		<English>They had struck deeper into the Fane than any human army ever had. They had allies to watch their back, to guard the other passes. Brave Malakim champions, Balseraph mimics unpredictable but strangely reliable, and of course the heavenly armies of the Mercurians, giving grudging respect to their comrades. But the Bannor were ever at the vanguard. It was what they lived for. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Not one among this army had seen the fires of hell before, save the Commander. Those men and women who had crossed from that wretched land into world of Erebus were a dying generation. But the story of their journey survived in tales every young Bannor boy and girl learned, learned well and knew better than to doubt in the presence of their elders. The fierce dedication that had seen these people through constant war held them still enthralled, as well. This history and national character came together, leaving the Bannor knights, crusaders, and priests unflinching as they marched though the Fane, unrelenting, until even the terrible arch-angel Hyborem was overthrown. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Capria surveyed the ruins of Dis, the sprawling city Hyborem had ruled. Its dungeons were labyrinthine, and its streets filled with fiendish traps. Vile sights met the Bannor at every turn, men crucified and impaled, hanging from towers and buried up to their necks. It would be long and grim work razing the city while sanctifying those souls trapped here. But it brought some satisfaction to dismantle the apparatus of Hell on earth.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]They had not found what she came to find, but what they had accomplished was monumental, world changing. Surely more important than a personal quest to repay a priceless debt. She sighed and turned the corner, bringing the palace into view, the last refuge of the Fane. It had been pummeled by Bannor catapults, but in the ruins sat a wavering portal. The mages that accompanied her set about closing it, when from the rubble a group of hell hounds charged towards them. Capria threw herself in the way of the mages, buying time for them to get to cover. She braced for impact behind her shield, but the hound was felled from behind by a hurled spear. The other hounds rushed past her, fleeing, not attacking. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Capria lowered her shield and gasped as she saw who it was, even as she had hoped to find him. Donal Lugh, a fabled Bannor hero. Everyone who emerged from Hell all those years ago was a hero, but they all remembered the one who stayed behind, allowing them to escape with their savior Sabathiel to guide them. His hair and beard had grayed, but it was undeniably him. "Donal... I came to find you."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Donal clasped the old woman, steadying her. "Aye, little one. And I thank you for it. Surviving hell was one thing took everything I had. Emerging here, in the Infernals' strongest outpost on Erebus almost made me lose hope. Until I heard that this place was under assault. I knew my people had come to finish things, to pay the demons back for what they took."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"I never got to thank you. We need you back, old friend. We have lost Sabathiel. So many have lost their way, seeking power over justice." [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Donal held her still, and the ancient warrior and leader quieted. "The next battle will come soon enough. I will be there. It is unending for us-that is why we were chosen. But we can take a rest. I think we've earned it." Behind them the portal closed with a crash, as the Bannor mages severed the Fane from Agares's vault.</English>

		<English>At first, I thought I had arrived at Amathaon's heaven. I had cheated, stolen, committed crimes beyond count, even sent Perpentach's idiot daughter to face Hell itself, and yet I had made it to paradise! Maybe the gods were rewarding me for ridding them of that spoiled brat.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I beheld gardens, beautiful statuary, a sky that held fairy-tale clouds, and great angels dressed in pink and white. Great angels, with horns and large teeth.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The gardens, I noticed as my vision cleared, grew gulagarms, razorweed, and other, even more hellish plants. The statuary depicted not handsome men and beautiful women, but succubi and demon princes. The sky, I saw, was actually more red than pink, and the clouds were coming from an active volcano.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]This was not the hell I had imagined awaiting me, but it was hell nonetheless. One of the great demons, absurdly dressed but still terrifying, marched towards me. "Princess Keelyn wants you to dance," it said.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Princess... Keelyn?" I muttered, unable to believe what I'd heard. I was dragged to a great central hall, where upon a demonic throne made for giants was placed another throne, of mortal scale, that looked like it had come from a giant doll-house. Keelyn sat upon that throne. I could not believe it, Princess Keelyn was sitting on Hyborem's throne. I had sent her off to die, and she had overthrown the Lord of the Balors.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"You're that advisor. The one who gave me the boat."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Yes," I said. "Remember all the fun we had together..."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"You didn't like me," she said. "You were always mean to me. The only nice thing you did was give me that boat..." she leaned close and then smiled, "and that was because you thought I'd die."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I stared, unsure how to respond to the new Lady of the Balors.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Dance," she ordered. I danced. I'm not sure how long for. She clapped and was clearly amused, but demanded I keep dancing. So I did. I kept dancing until I collapsed, unable to continue. "Don't stop! Keep dancing!" she demanded. But I couldn't. "Guards," she yelled, "he won't dance! Throw him in the Naughty Pit!"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]As I was dragged away by a Balor, I knew that the Naughty Pit was going to be far worse than dancing until collapse. The screams to which I was being dragged towards suggested that, as did the cruelly stupid grin upon the Balor's face.</English>

Great angels, with horns and large teeth.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The gardens, I noticed as my vision cleared, grew gulagarms, razorweed, and other, even more hellish plants.

I was dragged to a great central hall, where upon a demonic throne made for giants was placed another throne, of mortal scale, that looked like it had come from a giant doll-house.

I danced. I'm not sure how long for. She clapped and was clearly amused, but demanded I keep dancing. So I did. I kept dancing until I collapsed, unable to continue. "Don't stop! Keep dancing!" she demanded. But I couldn't. "Guards," she yelled, "he won't dance! Throw him in the Naughty Pit!"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]As I was dragged away by a Balor, I knew that the Naughty Pit was going to be far worse than dancing until collapse.

There was still a palatable feeling of loss but it was as if remembered from a dream now past.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]With the light came angels, not the barbaric ones that traveled with Basium, but gentle compassionate creatures that tended to the wounded men and spirits alike. The darkest spirits had been dragged into hell when the Throne of Hell was destroyed, but thousands still remained, those stolen unfairly by the demons or trapped between the ideals of heaven and the failure of hell.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I walked among them, blessed souls seeking forgiveness, shared the pain with those who had carried it alone for so long. Other members of my army were the same, weary but unwilling to stop tending to these souls. It was as if we rescued a kingdom under a cruel despot, but no one had suffered as horribly as these souls had. For many it was the first kindness they had experienced in centuries.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]As I walked I saw a twisted dark tree on the wastes. Ropes hung from its limbs and it looked, as the rest of this world, to be deeply tortured. An adept sanctified the ground around the tree, turning it from charred to deep green and the tree disappeared. From where it was Talia's spirit walked toward me.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]We stared at each other in silence. I was exhausted and battle scared, she was a pale ghost, floating just above the ground in sheer robes that clung to her. She looked like a grey shadow of herself on the day we wed, strong and beautiful.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"I will always love you."

Save these lands and you save me, sleep in heliotrope fields and you will dream of me. I will ever love and dream of you."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]With that she was gone and I fell to my knees and wept.

I don't have to follow anyones rules."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Very well, than we kneel before you... as... the new Queen of the Fane of the Lessers, glorious mistress of..." another slice, another scream of pain.[PARAGRAPH:1]"I prefer Princess of the Fane.

		<English>I am forever held within the ravages of war. I am the last warrior of the Godswar and I will carry this battle across Erebus, through every civilization of men, into the stronghold of the Infernals and into hell itself if needed.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]But I am no fool. Men are weak, painfully short sighted and prone to betrayal for meaningless reasons. They trade their virtue for dirt, for skirt, or far less. Despite their weakness Erebus is their world, so the compact has decreed. And where the death of my angels is a loss forever, the tides of men seem endless. What need is there for immortality when the generations pouring forth from their dirty cities come faster than they can be extinguished, and each more pallid and anemic than the last. But this war cannot be won without them.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]There seems some small hope in this generation. Glorious Sabathiel has guided the Bannor through hell itself, and these men survived the trip. Now they mean to sail to the Fane of Lessers, to rescue a companion thought long lost. To walk an army into Hyborem's lands and take what they wish.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]And even spineless Lugus has a High Priest among the Malakim willing to stand against the demons. He sails for the Fane as well, but for revenge. It is a lesser reason than the salvation of the world, but it will do. It amazes me how men can become so passionate about the plight of one soul but so blatantly ignore the rest.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Regardless I have long watched the Fane, as a shepherd watches the forest that houses the wolves. With two strong armies moving against the demons the Mercurians will join. These men I command have lost what they love to the Infernal. They fight on raw passion, and will serve me well in life, and continue to serve as angels if they fall on the battlefield. The Bannor and the Malakim may only distract the Infernals, but we have the opportunity we seek. The war set into motion at the signing of the compact reaches its conclusion here. I will lead an army into the Fane of Lessers, I will purge the Infernal from Erebus.</English>

That Donal Lugh, who was trapped in hell so long ago, was still alive. She quickly dressed and headed to the shipyard, she needed a galleon and a few troops to rescue him.

		<English>"I'm getting a new pet," Princess Keelyn happily announced one day. "Don't worry, Chuckles, you're still my favorite. But this new one is going to be really fun!" She bounded eagerly down the steps to her summoning chamber.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Her newest circle was the largest one I'd ever seen. Normally, she summons imps, other balors, and occasionally elementals. But this new circle was bigger even than the one she summoned me with. I remember it clearly; I'd been so full of anger, so hateful then. But Keelyn taught me to be happy. And I was happy. And now I served her, since she was nice to me as long as I wasn't naughty.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I examined the runes, they read "Hyborem." I'd heard that name... I thought back. It was hard, remembering the bad days. But the name... scared me for some reason.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Who are you summoning, Mistress?" I asked.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"I was reading this book my from my daddy's library, and it said the biggest demon of them all was Hyborem. So I'm going to summon him."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Hyborem. Why did that seem like a bad idea? All the other demons Keelyn summoned learned to love their new master. But for some reason, I was worried. Hyborem must have been scary in the bad days, even scarier than I was. Keelyn snapped her fingers, and her puppets jolted into motion. They began dancing as Keelyn chanted the words of the summoning spell. And the Lord of the Balors appeared before us.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Hyborem was big. Huge. He barely fit in the summoning circle. He roared as he struggled against the bounds.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Who dares call me from my palace? What mortal is arrogant enough to..." he looked down. "What have we here, a little girl, mixed blood of the insane and the profane? This is a fine sacrifice. Release me, and I'll take my sacrifice and decide your fate. Your agony will only be temporary, and I'll let you live for now. Just remember... next time you summon me, ask, do not command." Hyborem looked at me and rose to his full height. "You! Throw me my sacrifice, and then reveal this foolish mage."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Why are you giving me orders?" I asked.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Hyborem stared. He ragged against the circle. The bonds constrained him, a fact that only infuriated Hyborem more. "You dare question your lord?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"No," I said. "I obey Princess Keelyn."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Hyborem looked at me, noticed the pink bow around my horns, and then glanced at the matching bow in Keelyn's hair. He brought his face as close to Keelyn as the summoning circle would allow. "Pedicabo ego vos et irrumabo. In the history of Erebus, none have been as arrogant as you. You take my servants from me and summon me like some common imp?" Again, Hyborem thrashed at the circle. But Princess Keelyn's circles held. He growled. "There is no agony in hell horrible enough for you. I will suffocate you on the excrement of Abyssus, you will spend ages in a pit filled with the screaming aborted fetuses of depraved whores. I will devise a new punishment, just for you... and that treasonous idiot." With that, Hyborem muttered a spell and vanished.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Where'd he go?" Keelyn asked.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I looked back into my memories. "The Fane of Lessers," I answered, though the words meant nothing to me.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Keelyn leaped up the stairs before running into a pair of Perpentach's advisors.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"My princess," one said, "we weren't expecting you to be done so soon."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"My new pet got away," Keelyn said, "and I need to go punish him."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Where'd he go?" asked the other advisor.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"The Fane of Lessers. His name is Hyborem and he has a very naughty mouth."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The advisors stared at each other. "You would chase Hyborem to his own realm because... he wouldn't play tea party?! You could get killed..." the other advisor elbowed the speaker in the stomach. They glanced conspiratorially at each other. They briefly spoke in whispers, before saying, with suspicious smiles, "we'll arrange for a galleon and some... volunteers... to help you." As we left, I could have sworn I heard one mutter, "what if she succeeds?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The other snickered. "Don't worry. She's as good as dead."</English>

		<English>I forgave her, but she couldn't forgive herself.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It wasn't unusual for Talia to worship at dusk. She revered it as I revered the dawn. She said that as the world slept the spirits came out to wander across it and often slipped into bed late, warm from the magic she channeled and smelling of the heliotrope flowers that covered the shrine she kept in the temple. She was beautiful and I loved her.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I arose one morning to find that she never came to bed. It was three days since she told me about her affair and through many tears, both in anger and sadness, we worked through it. I promised myself that I would forget what she had done, that I would trust her again. But in seeing the empty bed my mind leapt to suspicions.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I found her body laying before her shrine. She had expended her spirit entirely in casting, let her life flow from her for no reason other than to give it up. There was a short note with her, it read simply "I'm sorry."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]There was no salvation for her. And I shed tears once again at the altar of Lugus. Angels tended to me, brilliant compassionate beings who cried along with me. In time we divined Talia's last hours. She hated the pain she caused me and prayed for some relief. But the druidic spirits consoled only time and patience to heal those wounds. Another voice had offered a more immediate solution.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]That was the demoness Lethe, Queen of Sorrow. She whispered to Talia as she had thousands before. Bade her to forget her life and enter the abyss to escape her pain. And Talia followed it, killing herself at the shrine, believing somehow that she was making it easier for me.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Now we sail towards an idyllic beach. The tides beat regularly against white sand that rises smoothly to a thick ridge of mountain. It's hard to believe that the Fane of Lessers, the place where Agares dwelt during the Godswar, where the souls of the damned are drawn, lies beyond those mountains.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]This may be madness. To assault the stronghold of evil with only those few volunteers that could join me on this galleon. But Lethe is somewhere within that twisted hellish terrain, and I will make sure that her voice, and those the demon lords that dwell with her, will be removed from Erebus.</English>

		<Italian>I forgave her, but she couldn't forgive herself.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It wasn't unusual for Talia to worship at dusk. She revered it as I revered the dawn. She said that as the world slept the spirits came out to wander across it and often slipped into bed late, warm from the magic she channeled and smelling of the heliotrope flowers that covered the shrine she kept in the temple. She was beautiful and I loved her.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I arose one morning to find that she never came to bed. It was three days since she told me about her affair and through many tears, both in anger and sadness, we worked through it. I promised myself that I would forget what she had done, that I would trust her again. But in seeing the empty bed my mind leapt to suspicions.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I found her body laying before her shrine. She had expended her spirit entirely in casting, let her life flow from her for no reason other than to give it up. There was a short note with her, it read simply "I'm sorry."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]There was no salvation for her. And I shed tears once again at the altar of Lugus. Angels tended to me, brilliant compassionate beings who cried along with me. In time we divined Talia's last hours. She hated the pain she caused me and prayed for some relief. But the druidic spirits consoled only time and patience to heal those wounds. Another voice had offered a more immediate solution.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]That was the demoness Lethe, Queen of Sorrow. She whispered to Talia as she had thousands before. Bade her to forget her life and enter the abyss to escape her pain. And Talia followed it, killing herself at the shrine, believing somehow that she was making it easier for me.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Now we sail towards an idyllic beach. The tides beat regularly against white sand that rises smoothly to a thick ridge of mountain. It's hard to believe that the Fane of Lessers, the place where Agares dwelt during the Godswar, where the souls of the damned are drawn, lies beyond those mountains.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]This may be madness. To assault the stronghold of evil with only those few volunteers that could join me on this galleon. But Lethe is somewhere within that twisted hellish terrain, and I will make sure that her voice, and those the demon lords that dwell with her, will be removed from Erebus.</Italian>

		<English>The Balseraph soldiers stood entranced by the singing of the demon Lethe; a song of sorrows and cruelties of the mortal world, and the painlessness of oblivion. Some soldiers felt an urge to obey her calls, others only a creeping dread. But as terrible as it was, it was also hauntingly beautiful.[PARAGRAPH:1]Keelyn, apparently immune to the enchantment of demons, only said, "she sings nice. Even better than my little birdy. Bring her to me, so she can be my new little birdy. Have a big cage made, she won't fit in the old one."[PARAGRAPH:1]The most strong-willed soldiers were snapped out of their awe by Keelyn's command, and the fear of being fed to Balors. They began preparing for their princess's wish. The wisest began looking for metal for a cage, excusing themselves from the potential battle. To deal with those that remained entranced, Keelyn placed a curse upon one of the them. So wrapped up in the song, he hardly noticed the spell... until Keelyn activated the curse, sending unimaginable pain through his body, while leaving him unable to die, or even slip into unconsciousness. He screamed, drowning out the siren's song and breaking the trance.</English>

		<English>Commander Achare led the hunters personally; he wanted to see the lay of the land of a site that would almost certainly be a battlefield in the coming weeks. He didn't know that they were walking into a Doviello ambush-but that wouldn't have stopped him. Life was struggle, and Bannor commanders don't survive it by leading from the rear. They survive it by being very good fighters as well as leaders.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]And by being lucky when they need to be. A horde of Sons of Asena sprang from the woods, icy winds at their back. The Bannor hunters formed ranks quickly, sending in their wolves to skirmish as they fired at their attackers with short bows. Doviello men were not deterred by charging wolves, and the Bannor prepared to go down fighting.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]But the Doviello stopped their charge, turned and faced new threat from behind them. Emerging from the darkness came Moroi, the savage foot soldiers of the Calabim. The Doviello were quickly dispatched, as the Moroi matched their ferocity with surprise.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Bannor commander kept his men alert. Though they hadn't had a reason to enter Calabim lands, he wasn't ignorant of the world. The Calabim were monsters, and he would happily lead a crusade into their cities if ordered. Worse, they had sided with the Sheaim and Infernal in Tempus Mor, the very battle he had been training to join when Auric led his armies into Torrolerial and sacked the great city, seemingly slaying the Bannor leader Sabathiel in the process. But no blood had been spilled between them yet, and he awaited some announcement from their saviors.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Men of the Bannor," the Calabim commander began, emerging from the ranks of his soldiers, then stopped. "Well. Hello father."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Samatheon Achare froze, seeing his fugitive son Decius before him. "So. This is where you ended up. I must admit that after we discovered your innocence I hoped you were still alive... but I think death would have been preferable to this."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Innocent?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Yes. Well, innocent of witchcraft and blasphemy. Guilty of knocking out three of your father's teeth with an idol. It was planted by Arret, Rosier's uncle. We found out he was a necromancer and veil disciple during the sack of Torrolerial. It seems he framed you to throw off suspicion aroused by Rosier's betrayal."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"So it took the near destruction of your beloved nation to show you the error of your ways."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"What? We face a setback, but our whole history has been one pitched battle, Decius, you know that. I do not apologize for what transpired between us. You should have come along and faced trial rather than assault me and flee. How were we to take that other than as a confirmation of guilt?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"A trial would have found me innocent?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Probably. Possibly not. Sometimes innocents suffer; this is a consequence of the imperfection of our world. Law and order are the only way for society to function, and guilty must pay, even if occasionally an innocent is blamed."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Decius said, "Blood means nothing to you?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"I've shed tears for you already Decius, but I will weaken my civilization to favor my own children. Why are you here? To strike your revenge while we are weakened?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Hardly. From what I hear, the last ice age was rather hard on the Calabim who make up my imperial troops. I aim to prevent the next one."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Commander Achare sheathed his sword and turned his back. "Then we are allies, for a time."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"And after?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Most certainly not. You lead a band of murderers, and bring dishonor on your family. I hope you fall in battle, son, there is little other hope of your redemption now."</English>

		<Italian>Commander Achare led the hunters personally; he wanted to see the lay of the land of a site that would almost certainly be a battlefield in the coming weeks. He didn't know that they were walking into a Doviello ambush-but that wouldn't have stopped him. Life was struggle, and Bannor commanders don't survive it by leading from the rear. They survive it by being very good fighters as well as leaders.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]And by being lucky when they need to be. A horde of Sons of Asena sprang from the woods, icy winds at their back. The Bannor hunters formed ranks quickly, sending in their wolves to skirmish as they fired at their attackers with short bows. Doviello men were not deterred by charging wolves, and the Bannor prepared to go down fighting.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]But the Doviello stopped their charge, turned and faced new threat from behind them. Emerging from the darkness came Moroi, the savage foot soldiers of the Calabim. The Doviello were quickly dispatched, as the Moroi matched their ferocity with surprise.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Bannor commander kept his men alert. Though they hadn't had a reason to enter Calabim lands, he wasn't ignorant of the world. The Calabim were monsters, and he would happily lead a crusade into their cities if ordered. Worse, they had sided with the Sheaim and Infernal in Tempus Mor, the very battle he had been training to join when Auric led his armies into Torrolerial and sacked the great city, seemingly slaying the Bannor leader Sabathiel in the process. But no blood had been spilled between them yet, and he awaited some announcement from their saviors.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Men of the Bannor," the Calabim commander began, emerging from the ranks of his soldiers, then stopped. "Well. Hello father."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Samatheon Achare froze, seeing his fugitive son Decius before him. "So. This is where you ended up. I must admit that after we discovered your innocence I hoped you were still alive... but I think death would have been preferable to this."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Innocent?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Yes. Well, innocent of witchcraft and blasphemy. Guilty of knocking out three of your father's teeth with an idol. It was planted by Arret, Rosier's uncle. We found out he was a necromancer and veil disciple during the sack of Torrolerial. It seems he framed you to throw off suspicion aroused by Rosier's betrayal."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"So it took the near destruction of your beloved nation to show you the error of your ways."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"What? We face a setback, but our whole history has been one pitched battle, Decius, you know that. I do not apologize for what transpired between us. You should have come along and faced trial rather than assault me and flee. How were we to take that other than as a confirmation of guilt?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"A trial would have found me innocent?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Probably. Possibly not.

The Bannor hunters formed ranks quickly, sending in their wolves to skirmish as they fired at their attackers with short bows. Doviello men were not deterred by charging wolves, and the Bannor prepared to go down fighting.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]But the Doviello stopped their charge, turned and faced a new threat from behind them. Malakim warriors, dressed for the arctic battle in lion fur coats, descended upon the Doviello. The wild men turn on them in a rage, but the newcomers to the Aquillo tundra hold their lines, showing a discipline matching the Bannor's. The Bannor commander ordered his hunters to strike, and the Doviello ambush is turned to a rout, with Malakim cavalry chasing down the survivors.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Commander Samatheon Achare stepped forward to offer thanks to their saviors, but stopped when he saw who stepped out to greet him. "I see the Bannor sent their best to stop the end of the world."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Decius? By Junil, I had feared you dead."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"No. I am not dead. I have traveled the ends of the earth to seek refuge from false accusations, but I live and am better for it."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"False accusations. Not false, for I accused you in good faith, but wrong nonetheless. Arret, Rosier's uncle, was revealed a necromancer in the sacking of Torrolerial. But the evidence before my eyes could not be ignored. A man cannot show favoritism to his own kin over the rule of law-that is the way of anarchy and tyranny. I have long grieved for what transpired between us-that you would see your own father as your persecutor, that the promise your life showed should be wasted."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"I understand. I cannot say I regret my flee from justice, but I absolve you. The Bannor notion of righteousness is lacking-incomplete. But you served me well in my youth, and gave me a love of goodness and honor that I was able to preserve, despite everything. My time with the Malakim, these men who now follow me, allowed me to grasp the complete vision-justice paired with redemption and reconciliation. It will be good to speak of these matters further with you, should we survive this war with Auric."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Yes. Although it would be best for you to avoid the Bannor lands. You are not a heretic, but you did strike your commanding officer."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Uncompromising even as the fate of the world hangs in the balance?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"How else do you think we survived this long, my son? I am glad to see you in a good place. But do not expect us to change, not so fast. Perhaps as we work with your Overcouncil, we can test these new ideas that Varn Gosam is teaching. Well. We must report back, and lady Capria will be pleased to hear that you are here supporting us. Be well."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"And you," Decius replied, before turning back to his army.</English>

		<English>Across the Aquilo Tundra leaders sat in war rooms staring at scattered maps on long tables. Rhoanna was determined and anxious, pushing her captains to make immediate attacks against the Doviello and the Illians before they prepare their defenses. Capria, always aware of the threat of overextension, advised her captains to carefully guard their foothold on Auric's island and expand slowly. Falamar landed offshore from the tundra so that he could train units and launch attacks without fear of direct retaliation.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Their enemies were no different. Riuros, Anagantios and Dumannios had little concern for the meager boats that landed on their shores, but Lucian took the invasion more seriously and he was glad to see Mahala arrive with more soldiers.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"You have done well." Mahala said, "News of your victories has drawn many Doviello from the wastes looking for blood, or to be nearby when Auric's rewards are handed out."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]She paused, looking through one of her supply chests for a belt of short knives, before asking, "Is it true that Cassiel is dead?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Yes. Midgar burned to the ground and their king was sacrificed in one of Auric's rituals."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"If the stories are true then you and the Illian commanders are the first to witness the death of an archangel. What was it like?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Lucian shifted uncomfortably, "He died poorly, chained like a dog and serving his enemies' purpose in his death instead of his own."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Let us hope that we fare better than he did." Mahala said half-joking, but Lucian remained quiet.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"I have been to Auric's capital." Mahala said, switching the subject, "I have seen the pillar of light from his ritual, felt the welling power of a god soon to be born, and watched the dragon circling the city. It is hard to imagine that Auric will not succeed, and if he does we are best to be on his side when he does. Are these your thoughts as well?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Lucian considered. He was a powerful man among the Doviello, strong, clever and brutal. Although very capable, there were thousands of men like him across Erebus. Those born among the Lanun became pirates living on the edges of their society, their lawlessness made them feared by victims and fellow pirates alike, and outcasts from their own society. Among the Bannor men like him were quickly imprisoned or sent to the gallows. Success isn't a result of talent alone, but of your talents value in your society. One society's general is another's criminal, one society's artist is another's madman.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Yes." Lucian answered, "The Doviello cannot live in this world, we must return to an older one if we are to flourish."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Very well, we have only to scatter these fledgling armies until Auric completes his ritual. Then we will return to our more primal world."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Falamar never imagined himself as a commander of anything but his own ship. For him supply lines were something to be intercepted and pilfered, not guarded. A treasury should finance nights of excess, not a growing war.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"We have delivered Rhoanna to the war." Amergin offered.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It was as close as loyal Amergin ever came to questioning his captain, the implication that they had earned some rest after their defeat of Tebryn in the Dead Lands.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Yes, I suppose we have. But if she defeats Auric, what sort of victory will it be, and how can we miss the opportunity to participate in such legends." Falamar answered.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"We have gone from hunting wolves to demonic armies, played parts in the Momus's crazed game and watched our brothers reborn as undead before our eyes. These may be legends, but there is little glory in them."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Falamar nodded. "And if she fails, what then? What sort of world will it be? Can even the Black Wind sail fast enough to escape the grip of eternal winter, or will we all share Malus's fate?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"No." Amergin answered, "The Lanun could not survive in that world, we must save this one."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Amergin paused before adding, "Forgive my ramblings, I am ever at your side. I have been away from my rum for too long, and it muddies my thoughts."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Falamar smiled, placing two cups on the table and pulling a small cast from beneath it. He poured them both drinks as he smiled adding, "Or perhaps your time sober has made your thoughts too clear, that is never a good trait for a soldier."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]They laughed, toasted and drank into the night, sharing stories and planning for the hard days ahead.</English>

		<English>The Illian capital is a ring of military buildings around a massive pillar of pale white light. An intense cold radiates out from the light, frosting exposed flesh and reaching through the thickest furs to chill bones and freeze the breath. The Illian defenders are quickly cut down, they refuse to retreat into the pillar, seeming more afraid of what lies within it than the advancing army.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The capture of the city doesn't stop the ritual. Everyone can feel the welling power, the proximity to a powerful, divine, malevolent force. A few archers lob arrows into the pillar without effect, fire spells dissipate uselessly.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Decius sticks the Nether Blade through the veil of light, when he withdraws it is cold to the touch by undamaged. He sheaths the sword and goes back to where the commanders discuss a plan. With no good options Rhoanna breaks the stalemate. In one quick motion she pulls the Nether Blade from Decius's belt and charges into the light.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Stepping into the pillar is like entering a new world. Primal winds howl and the light is replaced with the white of a raging blizzard. Everything is white, and what was the flat ground of the city center is replaced with a steep mountainous slope.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Rhoanna crawls forward, she can feel the cold air tearing through her, like she has swallowed knives. Through the sleet of white she gets occasional glimpses of a steep mountainside behind her, and beyond a vast black swamp. Other howls give evidence that she isn't alone on the slope but she keeps climbing.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Her arms and legs go past cold, go past numb and start feeling warm. She is only sure she still drags the Nether Blade along with her because she can see it in her hand. Dreams begin to overcome her, the soft grasslands of her home, the feel of a saddle beneath her, the warmth of Falamar's bed.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]She stops moving, seeing another world around her as a frost giant lumbers out of the storm. Unwilling to smash such a nice meal he picks up the freezing Rhoanna in one giant fist. She curls up in his hand, then in a flash of clarity realizes where she is and stabs out with the sword, piercing his neck and sending the giant falling backwards. He is dead before he hits the ground. Determined, Rhoanna pulls the sword out of his neck and once again begins her ascent.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It is only a few hundred feet, but it feels like miles. By the time she can see the peak her arms and legs refuse to obey her. But she can see Auric standing on the peak unaffected by the raging blizzard around him. Around him, around the mountain itself, a god rages.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Auric looks at the woman staggering towards him. He is transcendent, a man at his most powerful, almost a god against a woman who is too stubborn to die. He smiles.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]For Tasunke she thinks, she tries to scream it but she can't muster the breath to force the words through frozen lips. She promises her body, one last rush and she will allow it to die, just another 20 feet. She staggers closer as Auric raises a hand and says, "Slow..."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Everything stops, her heartbeats stretch out weak and thin, even falling to her knees takes seconds and that last breath out of her body goes on for much longer. Her hair whips around her head at a slower rate than the wind and she simply stares at it in confusion.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Then blue eyes command her attention. Falamar places his hands over hers, tightening her grip on the sword. She can see the pain and cold in his eyes, the strain of pushing your body past its limits, the knowledge that you are already dead but still pressing on. But still he smiles and pulls her up onto her feet with the Nether Blade between them.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Auric looks irritated, as Rhoanna and Falamar charge forward he simply says, "Snowfall".[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A wall of snow so thick even Auric is blinded by it explodes out of him, but it does not stop them. Pushing through wall of ice the sword holds and they both jam it deeply into Auric's chest. For a second there is no sound on the mountaintop as Auric stands confused. Then he screams, a scream that is echoed by the spirit of the god above him and thousands of frost spirits that hunt the mountain. Then it is all gone.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In the Illian capital the light recedes into the bone colored sky leaving Rhoanna and Falamar lying alone in the center. Hippus and Lanun commanders rush in, calling for priests.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Don't think this gets you out of owing me a ship." Rhoanna quips as priests tended to both of them.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"I keep telling you, that was my brother-in-law." Falamar responds.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Night falls on combined armies, but no one sleeps. They are beyond tired, but still talk, laugh and celebrate on the tundra. And even a few of the Bannor soldiers relax and tell a few jokes, a sure sign that it must be a new age on Erebus.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]-- Epilogue --[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Ethne played beneath the Tulip Poplar tree. She could see the palace through a veil of fog and hear the distant sounds of the city beyond the palace grounds. Somewhere within the gardens other child ran and played, but she could not see them.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]This place, this dream, wrapped itself tightly around her. It was easy to believe. But nagging thoughts, the trials and pains of her life, would not let her rest. She was not a child, she was the ruler of an empire she loved, she had taken that empire to war, seen countless good soldiers die and she had been the victim of an assassin's attack.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It was this last thought that jarred her from the dream. That attack, the dark blade that stole her life and carried her soul to this place. She could see it clearly now, she was a child no more.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The shape of a palace obscured by fog remained, as did the spirits of children playing in the field. The Tulip Poplar tree was gone, until she looked for it, and then it reappeared. She wore a beautiful mourning gown, which is traditional for burial among the Elohim, but Ethne suspected it wasn't real either.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]As Ethne walked she found other spirits trapped within their own dreams, playing, sleeping or talking quietly to empty air. They seemed peaceful enough so she didn't disturb them. There was no wall around the palace grounds as she had imagined, and no city beyond, only the hazy surface of this world and a labyrinth of passages to chambers full of other dreams.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It was impossible to tell how long she walked. Some places were pleasant, a field of flowers and wild birds, a pond where a boy and a large yellow dog played together, a mother who eternally sung to her child. Others were darker, a shadowy forest inhabited by glowing moths, a cellar where Ethne heard crying but couldn't find anyone, a lost child calling eternally for help. And some of the chambers were just strange, there was a city that ran backwards, an empty carnival where spirits ran and hid from each other and a galleon coming straight out of the ground crewed by souls ever looking unsuccessfully for land.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Eventually Ethne wandered onto a small farm. A single barn stood on a field that had been recently harvested, the barn itself was well stocked with grain and the smell of freshly cut wheat filled the air. A man sat on a chair in front of the barn looking at a distant village, barely visible beyond the haze.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The man looked at Ethne as she approached.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"None of it is real." He said.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"I know," Ethne replied startled, "did you grow up on this farm?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Yes, on a farm like this."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Shackles snaked up through the ground and clasped onto the man wrists. Ethne turned to run but another pair grabbed her. They were both pulled through the surface of the ground, into a world without light, substance or breath. When they came out they were dropped into a summoning circle in a large vaulted ivory chamber. A man with a crown of mirrors and deep black pits instead of eyes stared at both of them. A blue skinned angel stood beside him and around the room hundreds of humans, elves, dwarves and orcs stood watching. Ethne knew they were all great people from many ages, kings and heroes.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Ethne. Auric." The man without eyes said, "Welcome to my palace. There are only two choices in the world of the dead, you wait endlessly, or you rebel. I am the leader of that rebellion, I am Laroth."</English>

Through the sleet of white she gets occasional glimpses of a steep mountainside behind her, and beyond a vast black swamp. Other howls give evidence that she isn't alone on the slope but she keeps climbing.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Her arms and legs go past cold, go past numb and start feeling warm. She is only sure she still drags the Nether Blade along with her because she can see it in her hand. Dreams begin to overcome her, the soft grasslands of her home, the feel of a saddle beneath her, the warmth of Falamar's bed.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]She stops moving, seeing another world around her as a frost giant lumbers out of the storm. Unwilling to smash such a nice meal he picks up the freezing Rhoanna in one giant fist. She curls up in his hand, then in a flash of clarity realizes where she is and stabs out with the sword, piercing his neck and sending the giant falling backwards. He is dead before he hits the ground. Determined, Rhoanna pulls the sword out of his neck and once again begins her ascent.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It is only a few hundred feet, but it feels like miles. By the time she can see the peak her arms and legs refuse to obey her. But she can see Auric standing on the peak unaffected by the raging blizzard around him. Around him, around the mountain itself, a god rages.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Auric looks at the woman staggering towards him. He is transcendent, a man at his most powerful, almost a god against a woman who is too stubborn to die. He smiles.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]For Tasunke she thinks, she tries to scream it but she can't muster the breath to force the words through frozen lips. She promises her body, one last rush and she will allow it to die, just another 20 feet. She staggers closer as Auric raises a hand and says, "Slow..."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Everything stops, her heartbeats stretch out weak and thin, even falling to her knees takes seconds and that last breath out of her body goes on for much longer. Her hair whips around her head at a slower rate than the wind and she simply stares at it in confusion.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Then blue eyes command her attention. Falamar places his hands over hers, tightening her grip on the sword. She can see the pain and cold in his eyes, the strain of pushing your body past its limits, the knowledge that you are already dead but still pressing on. But still he smiles and pulls her up onto her feet with the Nether Blade between them.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Auric looks irritated, as Rhoanna and Falamar charge forward he simply says, "Snowfall".[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A wall of snow so thick even Auric is blinded by it explodes out of him, but it does not stop them. Pushing through wall of ice the sword holds and they both jam it deeply into Auric's chest. For a second there is no sound on the mountaintop as Auric stands confused. Then he screams, a scream that is echoed by the spirit of the god above him and thousands of frost spirits that hunt the mountain. Then it is all gone.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In the Illian capital the light recedes into the bone colored sky leaving Rhoanna and Falamar lying alone in the center. Hippus and Lanun commanders rush in, calling for priests.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Don't think this gets you out of owing me a ship." Rhoanna quips as priests tended to both of them.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"I keep telling you, that was my brother-in-law." Falamar responds.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Night falls on combined armies, but no one sleeps. They are beyond tired, but still talk, laugh and celebrate on the tundra. And even a few of the Bannor soldiers relax and tell a few jokes, a sure sign that it must be a new age on Erebus.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]-- Epilogue --[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Ethne played beneath the Tulip Poplar tree. She could see the palace through a veil of fog and hear the distant sounds of the city beyond the palace grounds. Somewhere within the gardens other child ran and played, but she could not see them.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]This place, this dream, wrapped itself tightly around her. It was easy to believe. But nagging thoughts, the trials and pains of her life, would not let her rest. She was not a child, she was the ruler of an empire she loved, she had taken that empire to war, seen countless good soldiers die and she had been the victim of an assassin's attack.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It was this last thought that jarred her from the dream. That attack, the dark blade that stole her life and carried her soul to this place. She could see it clearly now, she was a child no more.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The shape of a palace obscured by fog remained, as did the spirits of children playing in the field. The Tulip Poplar tree was gone, until she looked for it, and then it reappeared. She wore a beautiful mourning gown, which is traditional for burial among the Elohim, but Ethne suspected it wasn't real either.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]As Ethne walked she found other spirits trapped within their own dreams, playing, sleeping or talking quietly to empty air. They seemed peaceful enough so she didn't disturb them. There was no wall around the palace grounds as she had imagined, and no city beyond, only the hazy surface of this world and a labyrinth of passages to chambers full of other dreams.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It was impossible to tell how long she walked. Some places were pleasant, a field of flowers and wild birds, a pond where a boy and a large yellow dog played together, a mother who eternally sung to her child. Others were darker, a shadowy forest inhabited by glowing moths, a cellar where Ethne heard crying but couldn't find anyone, a lost child calling eternally for help. And some of the chambers were just strange, there was a city that ran backwards, an empty carnival where spirits ran and hid from each other and a galleon coming straight out of the ground crewed by souls ever looking unsuccessfully for land.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Eventually Ethne wandered onto a small farm. A single barn stood on a field that had been recently harvested, the barn itself was well stocked with grain and the smell of freshly cut wheat filled the air. A man sat on a chair in front of the barn looking at a distant village, barely visible beyond the haze.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The man looked at Ethne as she approached.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"None of it is real." He said.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"I know," Ethne replied startled, "did you grow up on this farm?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Yes, on a farm like this."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Shackles snaked up through the ground and clasped onto the man wrists. Ethne turned to run but another pair grabbed her. They were both pulled through the surface of the ground, into a world without light, substance or breath. When they came out they were dropped into a summoning circle in a large vaulted ivory chamber. A man with a crown of mirrors and deep black pits instead of eyes stared at both of them. A blue skinned angel stood beside him and around the room hundreds of humans, elves, dwarves and orcs stood watching. Ethne knew they were all great people from many ages, kings and heroes.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Ethne. Auric." The man without eyes said, "Welcome to my palace. There are only two choices in the world of the dead, you wait endlessly, or you rebel. I am the leader of that rebellion, I am Laroth."</French>

		<Italian>The Illian capital is a ring of military buildings around a massive pillar of pale white light. An intense cold radiates out from the light, frosting exposed flesh and reaching through the thickest furs to chill bones and freeze the breath. The Illian defenders are quickly cut down, they refuse to retreat into the pillar, seeming more afraid of what lies within it than the advancing army.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The capture of the city doesn't stop the ritual. Everyone can feel the welling power, the proximity to a powerful, divine, malevolent force. A few archers lob arrows into the pillar without effect, fire spells dissipate uselessly.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Decius sticks the Nether Blade through the veil of light, when he withdraws it is cold to the touch by undamaged. He sheaths the sword and goes back to where the commanders discuss a plan. With no good options Rhoanna breaks the stalemate. In one quick motion she pulls the Nether Blade from Decius's belt and charges into the light.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Stepping into the pillar is like entering a new world.

		<English>Rhoanna lay tangled in the sheets. She was as beautiful and fierce as any woman, and a lifetime spent in the saddle had turned last night's passion into an athletic event. Falamar had always felt himself a more than adequate, some had said legendary, lover but Rhoanna was insatiable. Falamar slipped quietly from the bed in the fear that if she awoke she would not let him escape. He felt sudden sympathy for the wild mustangs Rhoanna had ridden until they broke and surrendered to her will.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Up on deck the sea air revived him and he stretched and called for a report from Amergin, and a hot tea from a deck hand.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"No rum captain?" the deck hand asked.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"My body aches enough this morning Rory, best to at least keep my mind sharp." Falamar answered, then turning to Amergin he said, "How close are we to the Dead Lands?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"We will be upon them by midday. There are already reports that the Sheaim are readying for us, and our advance ship returned during the night crewed by skeletons. We had to sink it ourselves."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Falamar's eyes widened and he called down to Rory in the mess, "on second thought I'll take a bit of rum with that, on the side." Looking back at Amergin he asked, "Anything else?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"The Dead Lands appear much as our own except at its heart where it's as defiled as Hyborems own lands. Tebryn has a spell around these lands that keeps anyone from entering without his approval. This spell is maintained by ritualists in the capital of his generals, Averax, Gosea and Malchavic. Until they are destroyed we won't be able to assault Tebryn directly."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Rory placed the hot tea and rum at Falamar's side and asked, "Anything else captain?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"No, thank you Rory." Falamar quickly drank the rum before asking Amergin to continue.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"There are reports that men who die within this region find their souls drawn to the black tower, where they are transformed into hellish versions of themselves, skeletons, wraiths, sect of flies, eidolons and such. I cannot imagine a worse fate for a man's soul, and for us it means that we will face any we lose in battle."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"I'm going to need more rum!" Falamar yelled to Rory, who quickly scrambled to refill Falamars goblet.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Anything else Amergin?" Falamar asked.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"The living seem unable to heal here. Those injured in the battle against the skeleton ship still bleed as if their wounds were fresh. These lands are cursed, and it does not favor us."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Falamar downed the second rum, "And what of the rum?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"We are well stocked captain."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Lock away my enemy in an unassailable location, subject me to the threat of eternal damnation as some wretched bone pile, remove from me even the tiny gifts of health and healing, but leave the rum."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Aye captain." Amergin grinned, a rare sight on the first mate.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"You had best rouse our guest and tell her everything you have told me. We will need all the strength we have by midday."</English>

		<English>There was a celebration that would make Perpentach himself jealous. When Tebryn died the black tower collapsed around him. Many wondered if he survived the attack until they noticed that the corruption of the land began to heal, as did the injured men. Everywhere men of various nations drank, sung and for the first time in months, relaxed.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Falamar grabbed a bottle of rare Svartalfar wine and went to find Rhoanna. The war kept them both so busy that he hadn't seen her for weeks, and he found himself almost as excited to see her as he was to defeat the Sheaim.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]He found her in a small group of her captains along with a Hippus messenger that Falamar didn't recognize. Expecting cheers from the group Falamar stopped when he noticed they spoke in hushed somber tones, even while the rest of the army celebrated around them. Even Rhoanna's dark eyes were swollen and red; she had been crying. But there were no tears now, only anger and determination.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Is everything alright?" Falamar asked. He set the wine down as it felt inappropriate to stand there dumbly holding it.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The captains quieted, they saluted Falamar but didn't answer the question. Rhoanna gave Falamar a weary smile, she was happy to see him and felt somehow relieved to have him close despite the recent news.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Tasunke is the head of the Aroul-Hippi, the most powerful Hippus clan. He is, he was, as close as we have to a king."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]She paused here. Falamar knew who Tasunke was, she had spoken frequently of him with both frustration and admiration. But even outside of Rhoanna's tales there weren't many in Erebus who hadn't heard of the mercenary king of the Hippus.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"The Illians are rising in the north." Rhoanna continued, "and they had hired Tasunke to fight for them. When they were finished with him, they killed him and turned on the Aroul-Hippi. There are a fragile few that were able to escape the purge. Altheriol-ta-Mealthiel is gone, our people are slaughtered and the only armies that remain are those that fought here."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Falamar sat down beside Rhoanna. The captains' faces were stern but it was obvious they had been arguing the next steps. Despite their great respect for Falamar, they considered this a Hippus matter and weren't willing to involve him unless Rhoanna did. But Falamar could guess the points of the argument, some of them wanted to seek revenge and attack the Illians and others wanted to withdrawal into lands that were safe and rebuild.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"The fate of the Hippus and Lanun are intertwined. You have our strength and friendship if you desire it."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Even if we sail against the Illians?" Rhoanna asked, "We have reports that their leader means to resurrect the god of winter and cast us into eternal winter. They prepare now for the ritual. Would you be so quick to jump from the fires of the Sheaim into the freezing winds of the Illians?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Falamar thought about it. He hadn't expected another war, and knew his men had more than earned their rest. They would be remembered for generations for what they had accomplished here. How could he ask them to exchange that for another desperate war?[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Rhoanna knew he would join her when she saw his crooked smile.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"That depends," Falamar asked, "would we get to share a flagship again?"</English>

Even Rhoanna's dark eyes were swollen and red; she had been crying. But there were no tears now, only anger and determination.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Is everything alright?" Falamar asked. He set the wine down as it felt inappropriate to stand there dumbly holding it.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The captains quieted, they saluted Falamar but didn't answer the question. Rhoanna gave Falamar a weary smile, she was happy to see him and felt somehow relieved to have him close despite the recent news.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Tasunke is the head of the Aroul-Hippi, the most powerful Hippus clan. He is, he was, as close as we have to a king."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]She paused here. Falamar knew who Tasunke was, she had spoken frequently of him with both frustration and admiration. But even outside of Rhoanna's tales there weren't many in Erebus who hadn't heard of the mercenary king of the Hippus.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"The Illians are rising in the north." Rhoanna continued, "and they had hired Tasunke to fight for them. When they were finished with him, they killed him and turned on the Aroul-Hippi. There are a fragile few that were able to escape the purge. Altheriol-ta-Mealthiel is gone, our people are slaughtered and the only armies that remain are those that fought here."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Falamar sat down beside Rhoanna. The captains' faces were stern but it was obvious they had been arguing the next steps. Despite their great respect for Falamar, they considered this a Hippus matter and weren't willing to involve him unless Rhoanna did. But Falamar could guess the points of the argument, some of them wanted to seek revenge and attack the Illians and others wanted to withdrawal into lands that were safe and rebuild.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"The fate of the Hippus and Lanun are intertwined. You have our strength and friendship if you desire it."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Even if we sail against the Illians?" Rhoanna asked, "We have reports that their leader means to resurrect the god of winter and cast us into eternal winter. They prepare now for the ritual. Would you be so quick to jump from the fires of the Sheaim into the freezing winds of the Illians?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Falamar thought about it. He hadn't expected another war, and knew his men had more than earned their rest. They would be remembered for generations for what they had accomplished here. How could he ask them to exchange that for another desperate war?[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Rhoanna knew he would join her when she saw his crooked smile.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"That depends," Falamar asked, "would we get to share a flagship again?"</French>

		<English>Piles of maps covered the table. Where a god once stood there was now topographic drawings, mana charts and heat summaries from various areas. Tasunke couldn't understand any of them. He was skilled at reading the terrain, troop movement and defensive fortifications, but these maps were a collection of obscure and what seemed to him to be irrelevant data. The priests of winter didn't agree.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]They were commanding the army now. Auric had withdrawn to his tent, leaving Lucian and Tasunke to deal with the priests. Tasunke didn't like dealing with underlings, and their search for a valley that didn't exist didn't inspire much confidence.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Tasunke left the meeting room. The camp was a mix of the three armies. The Doviello were too restless to make good neighbors and kept mostly to themselves, while the Hippus and Illians shared guard patrols, wine and stories. Tasunke crossed to the center of the camp where Auric's tent stood, Lucian had to sleep sometime and he wasn't on his usual station outside the tent. There were currently Hippus soldiers on guard and they didn't stand in Tasunke's way.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The inside of the tent was pitch black and so cold Tasunke stopped in surprise. Unable to see anything he considered going back through the thick curtains of the tent's entrance, but he steeled himself and continued into the tent, although slower.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Lord Auric? It is Tasunke, I've come to inquire on your orders for the Hippus."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Auric opened his eyes and the room was bathed in blue and white light. Darkness wrestled with the blue fire and the room flickered with dancing shapes. There were armies in those shapes, battles being fought, the ruins of great cities and creatures dark and powerful. Auric sat at its center, pale skin dripping with sweat that turned to ice in the freezing room. He opened his mouth to speak but no words came out.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Tasunke placed his hand on the hilt of his sword, this was no man, but a beast possessed of something far greater than himself. At first he thought to protect himself from whatever Auric had become, but then he thought that it may be an act of mercy to kill Auric and save him from this torture. But when Auric lurched forward Tasunke stepped back in fear.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Pristin Pass."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The words were mouthed by Auric but resonated through the tent from hundreds of different voices.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"There is only one entrance, and you must go under the mountains to reach it. Beware for it is already contested ground. We will have to clear the valley if we are to claim it."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Auric's skin paled as he spoke, then flushed nearly black as he looked at Tasunke. Tasunke nodded slowly at the strange abomination before responding.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"I will tell the priests your orders... Is there anything else you would wish from your army or the Hippus?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Auric coughed, a ragged inhuman sound that tore through him and caused him to spit wet buttery pieces of flesh out onto the floor. He wiped his mouth with his sleeve.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Do not bother me again, warn your men to guard me better and soon you will offer invaluable service to the god of winter."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In the dancing shadows of the rooms walls a dragon rose up and roared. Then Auric closed his eyes and the room fell back into silent darkness.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Tasunke felt his way out of the tent. Outside the sunlight brought welcome relief. But where his guards once stood, there were now only the frozen husks of bodies. Tasunke assigned new guards to the post, warning them to keep everyone out, then rushed to the priests to deliver Auric's message.</English>

There were currently Hippus soldiers on guard and they didn't stand in Tasunke's way.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The inside of the tent was pitch black and so cold Tasunke stopped in surprise. Unable to see anything he considered going back through the thick curtains of the tent's entrance, but he steeled himself and continued into the tent, although slower.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Lord Auric? It is Tasunke, I've come to inquire on your orders for the Hippus."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Auric opened his eyes and the room was bathed in blue and white light. Darkness wrestled with the blue fire and the room flickered with dancing shapes. There were armies in those shapes, battles being fought, the ruins of great cities and creatures dark and powerful. Auric sat at its center, pale skin dripping with sweat that turned to ice in the freezing room. He opened his mouth to speak but no words came out.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Tasunke placed his hand on the hilt of his sword, this was no man, but a beast possessed of something far greater than himself. At first he thought to protect himself from whatever Auric had become, but then he thought that it may be an act of mercy to kill Auric and save him from this torture. But when Auric lurched forward Tasunke stepped back in fear.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Pristin Pass."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The words were mouthed by Auric but resonated through the tent from hundreds of different voices.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"There is only one entrance, and you must go under the mountains to reach it. Beware for it is already contested ground. We will have to clear the valley if we are to claim it."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Auric's skin paled as he spoke, then flushed nearly black as he looked at Tasunke. Tasunke nodded slowly at the strange abomination before responding.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"I will tell the priests your orders... Is there anything else you would wish from your army or the Hippus?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Auric coughed, a ragged inhuman sound that tore through him and caused him to spit wet buttery pieces of flesh out onto the floor. He wiped his mouth with his sleeve.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Do not bother me again, warn your men to guard me better and soon you will offer invaluable service to the god of winter."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In the dancing shadows of the rooms walls a dragon rose up and roared. Then Auric closed his eyes and the room fell back into silent darkness.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Tasunke felt his way out of the tent. Outside the sunlight brought welcome relief. But where his guards once stood, there were now only the frozen husks of bodies. Tasunke assigned new guards to the post, warning them to keep everyone out, then rushed to the priests to deliver Auric's message.</Spanish>

		<English>Auric led the generals down into the dragon's chamber. Ice mana in the caverns wall bathed the chamber in pale blue light. The center of the chamber looked to have once been an underground lake, now frozen. Snow covered the surface and the remains of a dragon's skeleton was trapped in the ice.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Auric looked more human than he had when Tasunke entered his tent, though it was only through considerable effort that he was able to appear so. His sleeves were brown with dried blood and his skin glistened with moisture. Since the incident in the tent Tasunke copied Lucian's behavior and only stood quietly and didn't question the dragonless chamber.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Auric walked out onto the ice. Reaching the nose of the dragon skeleton he whispered into what may have once been the creature's ear. Tasunke risked a glance at Lucian, to see how he was reacting to their prize of a giant dragon corpse. But if Lucian was disappointed, or surprised at all, he didn't show it.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Then another ragged inhuman cough tore through Auric. He steadied himself on the giant skull and once he recovered he leaned in close and blew into the creature's mouth. Auric's breath was white with frost and it seemed to grow as it moved through the skeleton. It stuck to the bones like snow and from it grew muscles and flesh. As the group watched Drifa was reborn.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The dragon began to shift as her muscles grew. Still half skeleton Drifa lifted herself from the frozen lake, breaking the ice that held her and unfurling her wings. By the time she had shaken herself free of the lake she was fully formed of scales, teeth and thick muscles. Drifa leaned down and glared at Auric with perfect blue eyes.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Who are you to awake me so?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"I am your god, I am the resurrection of Mulcarn. And I am one step away from becoming the god of winter. You will serve me as you served him."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Drifa narrowed her eyes and studied Auric closely.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"To long have I slumbered, but I have a taste for the flesh of kings and though you may one day be a god, you are a king now. If you wish my service, you must sacrifice a king to me."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Auric nodded, unsurprised. He turned to leave the chamber, pausing only to whisper to Tasunke.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"It is your time to serve the god of winter."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The last thing Tasunke saw was Drifa rising up over him.</English>

		<English>"Falamar."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]There was nothing but darkness.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Falamar."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I twisted in my dreams. I still imagined the tentacle around my leg through the veil of fear and emptiness. I drifted toward eternal sleep, but something wouldn't let me go.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Falamar."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I opened my eyes and there was water all around, a world without earth or sky. I floated weightless in the current, forever falling in the seas caress.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]There was another above me, a woman, but as inhuman as she was beautiful. She was the tide, powerful but yielding, fleeting but eternal.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Who are you?" I asked.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"I am Condatis, the archangel of Danalin, God of the Sea."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Afraid, I tried to swim away from her. I wasn't religious but I had seen enough temples and asylums of those that worshiped Danalin to suspect that this wasn't the afterlife I intended. Even if it did feature floating billowy maidens.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Danalin? As in the overlords? Is this the heaven for cultists and zealots?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]She looked hurt. There was pain in her eyes, and love. I regretted my words.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"No." she replied.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Oh... are you my reward?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"No!" she said, this time there was anger in her eyes.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I seemed to be getting this all wrong so I just floated silently and let her speak.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"I led you to Keelyn so that she would take you to her father, but Hastur predicts my actions. An archmage, Tebryn Arbandi, means to destroy creation. Go to the Momus, convince him to supply you with a fleet then sail through the Arduro Straight to the Dead Lands. Defeat Tebryn so I have time to defeat Hastur."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"You sure you don't want Capria, or that guy that killed Mulcarn? I'm more of a steal-the-king's-galleon kind of hero."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]She smiled, "My young prince, we must all make do with what we have."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The water rippled and her face was replaced with the bearded face of Amergin. He was pulling me up on the beach.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Falamar, are you okay?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Im okay," I stammered through racking coughs, "how are the men?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Some are fine, others haven't been recovered yet."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I understood his meaning and picked myself up. After recovering far too few of my men from the sea we went to meet with Perpentach. He ignored the threat of Tebryn and my pleas for help. But he was holding a competition between warlords, and he promised to supply the navy I required if I won. With few men and no ships, we had little choice but to enter.</English>

		<English>Jubilee was in ruins. It was impossible to tell the difference between the Balseraph warriors and their citizens. A muscle-bound man would sit and drink solemnly while a foppish dandy or woman would attack with a club, sword or bare fists.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Falamar ordered his men to leave the innocents alone and strike only in defense. Enough people had already died and these people were just another set of victims to Perpentach's madness. Falamar just wanted to take their ships and sail away from the Cliffs of Hastur.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Beeri stopped Falamar as they neared the docks.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Those flags aren't Balseraph. The remnants of Uldanor's army look to be holding the docks, with reinforcements judging by the number of them."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Beeri was right. A long line of well outfitted Hippus troops stood along the docks, weapons at the ready. They held all the ships captive, including the warships Falamar meant to use to sail to the Dead Lands.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Lanun and Hippus met on the docks and eyed each other warily. When Uldanor pushed his way to the Hippus front Beeri called out to him.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"We earned Perpentach's fleet on the battlefield, we won't have you swoop in and steal it now. Are you ready to receive another beating trying?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Beeri held a grudge against the Hippus for his treatment at Tasunke's hands. Falamar was both shocked and amused by the Luchuirp's words, and had to steel himself to keep from laughing.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"If you wish a deal you must make it with me," a woman's voice shouted.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The call came from the bow of a Hippus galleon where a beautiful armored woman with long golden hair stood.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"I see you got your ship back." Falamar called.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Rhoanna looked surprised, then narrowed her eyes in mock anger. "No thanks to you."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"That was, I'll remind you, my brother-in-law's fault. I simply offered a ride to a lady in distress."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"For a price," she returned.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Well, I didn't want you to feel beholden to me."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]She huffed and signaled for Falamar to come onboard.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Beeri whispered "Don't trust them, there as likely to cage you like a wild boar as to hold their word."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Falamar nodded and crossed through the Hippus lines and up onto the ship's deck.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"You look lovely, command of an army suits you."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"And you as well, I didn't think pirates lead armies," she replied. "I need these warships to transport my men."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"I am taking these warships to the Dead Lands," Falamar answered. "I have my own war to wage."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"You won't get to the Dead Lands. The straight is overrun with devils. And no significant army can move through there. But..." and at this she smiled, "the Empyrean has hired us to join the Radiant Guard and defend Bourne the Gleaming from Hyborem's attack. If we can hold long enough for Basium to arrive the devils can be removed from the straight and you can sail through."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"So you want to hire me to transport your army to Bourne?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"We may be able to pay something. But as far as I can tell you need us as much as we need you," again she smiled.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Maybe," Falamar answered, "I will attack the Sheaim in the Dead Lands. There is no gold to be made there, but they mean to corrupt the world itself. If I help you in the straight, will you sail with me to the Dead Lands and join me against the Sheaim?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Yes," she said after a pause, "but we share the flagship."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"I would be honored to have you."</English>

If I help you in the straight, will you sail with me to the Dead Lands and join me against the Sheaim?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Yes," she said after a pause, "but we share the flagship."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"I would be honored to have you."</Italian>
		<Spanish>Jubilee was in ruins. It was impossible to tell the difference between the Balseraph warriors and their citizens. A muscle-bound man would sit and drink solemnly while a foppish dandy or woman would attack with a club, sword or bare fists.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Falamar ordered his men to leave the innocents alone and strike only in defense. Enough people had already died and these people were just another set of victims to Perpentach's madness. Falamar just wanted to take their ships and sail away from the Cliffs of Hastur.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Beeri stopped Falamar as they neared the docks.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Those flags aren't Balseraph. The remnants of Uldanor's army look to be holding the docks, with reinforcements judging by the number of them."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Beeri was right. A long line of well outfitted Hippus troops stood along the docks, weapons at the ready. They held all the ships captive, including the warships Falamar meant to use to sail to the Dead Lands.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Lanun and Hippus met on the docks and eyed each other warily. When Uldanor pushed his way to the Hippus front Beeri called out to him.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"We earned Perpentach's fleet on the battlefield, we won't have you swoop in and steal it now. Are you ready to receive another beating trying?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Beeri held a grudge against the Hippus for his treatment at Tasunke's hands. Falamar was both shocked and amused by the Luchuirp's words, and had to steel himself to keep from laughing.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"If you wish a deal you must make it with me," a woman's voice shouted.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The call came from the bow of a Hippus galleon where a beautiful armored woman with long golden hair stood.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"I see you got your ship back." Falamar called.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Rhoanna looked surprised, then narrowed her eyes in mock anger. "No thanks to you."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"That was, I'll remind you, my brother-in-law's fault. I simply offered a ride to a lady in distress."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"For a price," she returned.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Well, I didn't want you to feel beholden to me."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]She huffed and signaled for Falamar to come onboard.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Beeri whispered "Don't trust them, there as likely to cage you like a wild boar as to hold their word."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Falamar nodded and crossed through the Hippus lines and up onto the ship's deck.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"You look lovely, command of an army suits you."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"And you as well, I didn't think pirates lead armies," she replied. "I need these warships to transport my men."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"I am taking these warships to the Dead Lands," Falamar answered. "I have my own war to wage."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"You won't get to the Dead Lands. The straight is overrun with devils. And no significant army can move through there. But..." and at this she smiled, "the Empyrean has hired us to join the Radiant Guard and defend Bourne the Gleaming from Hyborem's attack. If we can hold long enough for Basium to arrive the devils can be removed from the straight and you can sail through."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"So you want to hire me to transport your army to Bourne?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"We may be able to pay something. But as far as I can tell you need us as much as we need you," again she smiled.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Maybe," Falamar answered, "I will attack the Sheaim in the Dead Lands. There is no gold to be made there, but they mean to corrupt the world itself. If I help you in the straight, will you sail with me to the Dead Lands and join me against the Sheaim?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Yes," she said after a pause, "but we share the flagship."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"I would be honored to have you."</Spanish>

		<English>Perpentach looked confused. His advisor whispered, rather loudly, that we had won his contest but he didn't seem to understand. I finally interrupted.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"You promised us a navy, to stop the Sheaim from destroying the world."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Many men have tried," he answered, still unsure. He looked closely at me, as if he didn't recognize me though we met many times during the contest.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Yes, but that was our deal. That you provide the ships to sail us through the Aduro Straight and into the Dead Lands."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Haven't enough Lanun died?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I ignored his question. Too many had died, especially in his brutal games.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Are you giving us the ships or not?" I asked. My men tensed behind me and mentally I reviewed each of the Balseraph guards we had seen since entering the palace. If we had to fight our way out while dragging Perpentach out by his pointy hat we would.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Yes indeed, it's only fair that I help to get you there. I'll give you ships though you're not done, you won't see them 'til another's won."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Not wanting to risk another bout of amnesia I simply thanked him and we headed to the docks to claim our ships. As difficult as he had been to deal with we could not question the quality of the ships he supplied. They were fully outfitted, and although a bit garishly colored, were both comfortable and suitable for battle.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]As we boarded I noticed Uldanor boarding a ship that was flying Hippus colors. It looked familiar so I headed down to meet the captain. Seeing her aboard I called up to her from the docks.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"I see you got your ship back."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Rhoanna looked surprised, then narrowed her eyes in mock anger. "No thanks to you."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"That was, I'll remind you, my brother-in-law's fault. I simply offered a ride to a lady in distress."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"For a price," she returned.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Well, I didn't want you to feel beholden to me."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]She huffed then, glancing over at the warships raising the Lanun flag, invited me onboard. Uldanor glared at me but I had only saved him the humiliation of being beaten by those deranged midgets. Still, it seemed a poor time to bring it up so I simply nodded towards him and walked over to where Rhoanna stood issuing orders to her crew.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"You seem in a hurry to set off," I pointed out. "Jubilee is supposed to hold an amazing festival after each contest, it would be a shame to miss it."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Satisfied that her crew was working she leaned against the railing and looked at me.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"I have no time for festivals," she replied. "I have an army to transport and you seem to control the warships we were planning to do it with."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]They were packing men and weapons as close as they could in the hold and the ship was already sitting unusually low in the water. These are the signs I was used to looking for in rich marks ripe with plunder. Despite the load there was still considerable stocks, weapons and Hippus soldiers waiting on the dock.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"I am taking these warships to the Dead Lands," I answered. "I have my own war to wage."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"You won't get to the Dead Lands. The straight is overrun with devils. And no significant army can move through there.

		<English>Rhoanna spoke to the unit commander in hushed tones. He wore the same golden armor as his men, but had passed through a few more winters, and his authority was obvious from the respect his men showed him. Falamar noticed that black tattoos snaked up from under his armor and wrapped around his neck and his left hand was covered with intricate tattoos, which was highly unusual for a commander of the Radiant Guard. He also looked pained, stressed beyond even the ravages of war.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Rhoanna walked back to where Falamar and the crew waited.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"He says Bourne is threatened from internal and external forces. He wants us to lead the troops in the field, to keep the Infernals from attacking Bourne while they fight the heretics inside the city."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Falamar walked close enough that they could talk without anyone overhearing.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Who is the commander? He looks afraid of more than death."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Rhoanna glanced back at the commander who was in the process of splitting his men, some to return to the city and other to stay and await orders.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"His name is Mikel, he's the son of an Emry," she answered. "He grew up among the Sheaim before splitting and dedicating his life to the Empyrean."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"That explains the tattoos. But that should make him less afraid of war."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"The heretics have captured his wife and three-year-old daughter. They demanded he take his men and abandon the city and he has refused. There isn't much hope he will be able to save them."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]She said this last part softly, but Mikel was behind her and had heard it. If the words affected him he didn't show it.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"I am the shield until the sword comes free," he intoned. "If you hold the line here I will scourge the heretics form Bourne and Basium will have a base to launch his war from. If the Infernals slip through your line then Bourne will fall and the devils will consume this land. I will give you some of the guard to stand with you. Will you battle Hyborem?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Yes," Falamar answered without hesitation, "take care of Bourne and leave the devils to us."</English>

		<English>Verchiel dropped to his knees and cried. He was an angel of Lugus, lord of the dawn and revelation, but he was unable to deliver his message. He knew where Mikel's wife and daughter were imprisoned, Verchiel was kneeling beside them in the ether. But Mikel was too full of fear and doubt to hear the angel's voice. The city's priests either didn't understand the message or were too busy praising the victory against the Infernals. Even now the heretics sat in the barrack's main hall planning to kill their two prisoners and dump the bodies into the sewers. They were only one floor above them and after weeks of being held within the barracks, the prisoners only had a few minutes left to live.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Why are you crying?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Verchiel stopped in surprise. He looked up to see Meegan, Mikel's three year old daughter looking at him quizzically.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Can you see me child?" Verchiel asked, equally puzzled.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Of course. What is your name?" she asked.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Hallah, Meegan's mother, sat staring at the iron-bound door of the cell as she had for weeks. The room they were trapped in was an old storage room, and still had a pile of old tools and supplies in it. She had been through it a dozen times but there was nothing that could help her escape. She tried to stay strong while Meegan was awake, and save her tears for when her daughter was sleeping. She was so lost in her thoughts it took her a minute to realize Meegan was holding a conversation with an old broom.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Chipmunk, who are you talking to?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Meegan smiled, "His name is Verchiel, he's an angel and he will help us get back to daddy."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Hallah had no words. At three years old her daughter had gone crazy. Hallah wasn't sure if she should be jealous of her daughter's hope, or condemn her for it.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"We need something shiny," Meegan said, going again through the pile of supplies. She finally found an old copper plate that seemed to satisfy her and she cleaned it as well as possible with the hem of her dress.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Hallah heard the door to the basement open. This time instead of the single footsteps of someone bringing them food she heard a group coming down the stairs. Hallah pulled Meegan into her arms and when she squirmed Hallah told her to be quiet.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]There was a jingle of keys and then the door opened. Six men, all of the conspirators were here. Two had swords drawn, one a knife and another had a rope he looked about to put to use.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Sorry deary," he said, "your husband's too stubborn for his own good."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]At that Meegan tore free of her mothers grip and stood protectively in front of her. She held the polished copper plate above her head and the men stepped back a bit at the sudden move. Nothing happened.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Then Meegan asked the broom, "what do I say?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Come on deary," the man carrying the rope said, "ain't no joy in killing a child. But it's either you go into the sewers or I go into the dungeon, and I ain't fool enough to consider that."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"You cannot hide your actions," Meegan shouted in a voice half her own and half unworldly, "Lugus will reveal all. If you mean to escape, then flee now into the darkness; this area has been claimed by the rose of summer!"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Hallah was more surprised than the men and they took a stunned step backwards. But realizing that no matter the threat they weren't about to be cowed by a three-year-old with an old plate, one of the swordsmen stepped towards Meegan.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The copper plate exploded in light. It was as if Meegan held the sun itself above her head. The men covered their eyes in pain, light flooded the storage room, the hallway and up into the barracks itself. Breaking free of every window or crack in the barracks walls light came spilling out onto the dark streets of Bourne. The Radiant Guard knew immediately that the power of Lugus was manifest within the city and rushed toward the barracks.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]One of the kidnappers yelled for his men to stand firm. The light burnt through to his eyes even when they were closed and covered by his arm. He placed his sword in front of him and risked one peek at where he thought the little girl was standing. When he looked he saw a golden angel standing before him with a blazing sword.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"You will not harm these people," the angel said.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The heretics fled up out of the barracks and into the street where they were met by the radiant guard and quickly arrested. Mikel was just starting to question one when his wife and daughter stepped out of the barracks. If there is any true hope or happiness left in Erebus, it existed there as Mikel swept them both up into his arms. It was hours before he let go of either of them.</English>

She held the polished copper plate above her head and the men stepped back a bit at the sudden move. Nothing happened.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Then Meegan asked the broom, "what do I say?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Come on deary," the man carrying the rope said, "ain't no joy in killing a child. But it's either you go into the sewers or I go into the dungeon, and I ain't fool enough to consider that."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"You cannot hide your actions," Meegan shouted in a voice half her own and half unworldly, "Lugus will reveal all. If you mean to escape, then flee now into the darkness; this area has been claimed by the rose of summer!"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Hallah was more surprised than the men and they took a stunned step backwards. But realizing that no matter the threat they weren't about to be cowed by a three-year-old with an old plate, one of the swordsmen stepped towards Meegan.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The copper plate exploded in light. It was as if Meegan held the sun itself above her head. The men covered their eyes in pain, light flooded the storage room, the hallway and up into the barracks itself. Breaking free of every window or crack in the barracks walls light came spilling out onto the dark streets of Bourne. The Radiant Guard knew immediately that the power of Lugus was manifest within the city and rushed toward the barracks.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]One of the kidnappers yelled for his men to stand firm. The light burnt through to his eyes even when they were closed and covered by his arm. He placed his sword in front of him and risked one peek at where he thought the little girl was standing. When he looked he saw a golden angel standing before him with a blazing sword.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"You will not harm these people," the angel said.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The heretics fled up out of the barracks and into the street where they were met by the radiant guard and quickly arrested. Mikel was just starting to question one when his wife and daughter stepped out of the barracks. If there is any true hope or happiness left in Erebus, it existed there as Mikel swept them both up into his arms. It was hours before he let go of either of them.</Italian>
		<Spanish>Verchiel dropped to his knees and cried. He was an angel of Lugus, lord of the dawn and revelation, but he was unable to deliver his message. He knew where Mikel's wife and daughter were imprisoned, Verchiel was kneeling beside them in the ether. But Mikel was too full of fear and doubt to hear the angel's voice. The city's priests either didn't understand the message or were too busy praising the victory against the Infernals. Even now the heretics sat in the barrack's main hall planning to kill their two prisoners and dump the bodies into the sewers. They were only one floor above them and after weeks of being held within the barracks, the prisoners only had a few minutes left to live.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Why are you crying?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Verchiel stopped in surprise. He looked up to see Meegan, Mikel's three year old daughter looking at him quizzically.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Can you see me child?" Verchiel asked, equally puzzled.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Of course. What is your name?" she asked.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Hallah, Meegan's mother, sat staring at the iron-bound door of the cell as she had for weeks. The room they were trapped in was an old storage room, and still had a pile of old tools and supplies in it. She had been through it a dozen times but there was nothing that could help her escape. She tried to stay strong while Meegan was awake, and save her tears for when her daughter was sleeping. She was so lost in her thoughts it took her a minute to realize Meegan was holding a conversation with an old broom.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Chipmunk, who are you talking to?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Meegan smiled, "His name is Verchiel, he's an angel and he will help us get back to daddy."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Hallah had no words. At three years old her daughter had gone crazy. Hallah wasn't sure if she should be jealous of her daughter's hope, or condemn her for it.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"We need something shiny," Meegan said, going again through the pile of supplies. She finally found an old copper plate that seemed to satisfy her and she cleaned it as well as possible with the hem of her dress.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Hallah heard the door to the basement open. This time instead of the single footsteps of someone bringing them food she heard a group coming down the stairs. Hallah pulled Meegan into her arms and when she squirmed Hallah told her to be quiet.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]There was a jingle of keys and then the door opened. Six men, all of the conspirators were here. Two had swords drawn, one a knife and another had a rope he looked about to put to use.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Sorry deary," he said, "your husband's too stubborn for his own good."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]At that Meegan tore free of her mothers grip and stood protectively in front of her.

		<English>The savant examined Mikel. Mikel was tied to a post that had been erected behind a small granary. The Infernals had several people tied up within the city and refused to kill anyone yet, and they wanted to make sure none of the prisoners could see each other, so each was alone. But they could hear each other in pain and agony. It was worse to imagine what was happening to the others than to actually see it. Especially with the horrifying demons that now walked the streets of Bourne. Except for being tied up Mikel had been left alone, but apparently it was his turn now.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A few members of the Sect of Flies came into the yard. They were decrepit and foul. They were named for the thousands of flies that lived on and about them, but worse parasites lived and feasted in their flesh. Their skin crawled with the pressure of the creatures that burrowed within it and their stench was like sweat and rotten flesh, as if a corpse had gone for a long jog.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Mikel wasn't afraid. He had seen horrible things when he lived among the Sheaim and he had already accepted that he was to die here. He prayed to Lugus for the purification of his soul, for forgiveness for his own weakness in being unable to protect the city, and for the souls of his wife and daughter who had been taken from him weeks ago. He was not afraid until he saw who they dragged out into the yard.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It was his wife Hallah. She was still alive, but beaten and bruised. They hadn't killed her, for a moment he was grateful for that, until he realized what they had saved her for.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Sect of Flies started by pulling off her clothes. She screamed and looked at Mikel in terror and shame as they debased themselves upon her. Their parasites fed on her as well, and they spread through any placed they touched. For hours they abused her in increasingly painful ways until finally her spirit was broken and she just lay quiet as they acted out their desires upon her. In time the burrowing parasites could be seen under her flesh and her body twitched and spasmed to the pain of being consumed from the inside out.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]By the time Hallah died Mikel had no prayers left in him. He had threatened, screamed, cried and finally begged for it to stop but the devils had ignored all of it. Mikel questioned everything in his life that lead him to this moment, was sorry for every decision. And that was before they brought out his daughter. By the time that torment was done the only thing left within Mikel was pain and hatred.</English>

		<English>When Sucellus withdrew from Erebus his children were left to rule themselves. They decreed that they would be ruled by two queens, each for half of the year. One queen ruled the summer court and under her the elves nurtured beauty and art, and trained in the vigilant defense of their empire. The other queen ruled the winter court which was made up of the mischievous members of the fey kingdom, the tricksters, illusionists and those fond of laughter and nights spent dancing under the stars. It continued like this all through the Age of Magic, the elven empire grew and revered Sucellus.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]That lasted until the god of Winter entered creation and dropped Erebus into an unending winter. Faeryl, queen of the winter court, refused to abandon her throne for as long as winter remained. The elves prayed for help and Sucellus answered, coming personally into creation to battle the god of winter. But Sucellus was killed in that battle and his children were left alone and godless.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Faeryl ordered that the worship of a dead god was useless and that the empire should instead revere Esus, the god of night and deception. The shrines of Sucellus were torn down, the priests unwilling to abandon their old faith were rejected from the elven nation. But the summer court rallied against this. Under Arendel, queen of the summer court, they raised an army and attacked the members of the winter court dropping the elves into a bloody civil war.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]As the world continued to cool from the presence of Mulcarn and the death of Sucellus it became less and less habitable. In time only small isolated pockets remained where the bands of elves could survive. Between the civil war and the cold both sides neared extinction. Eventually the winter made travel and attacks impossible and both sides were forced to put aside their war.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Over 400 years later Mulcarn was killed and summer returned. The surviving generations of elves were able to travel again, and they have not forgotten the Umbrawood, their ancient homeland, or the war that has not been settled. Now they meet again within the Umbrawood and this war must be played out to see who will control the elves in this new age.</English>

		<German>Als sich Sucellus von Erebus zurückgezogen hat, waren sich seine Kinder alleine überlassen. Sie verfügten, dass sie von zwei Königinnen beherrscht werden, jede für jeweils ein halbes Jahr. Eine Königin beherrschte den Fürstenhof des Sommers und unter ihr pflegten die Elfen die Schönheit und die Künste, und schulten sich in der wachsamen Verteidigung ihres Reiches. Die andere Köngigin herrschte über den Fürstenhof des Winters, welcher gemacht war für die bösartigen Bewohner des entrückten Königreiches, die Schwindler, Illusionisten und die törrichten Lacher und Tänzer nachts unter dem Sternenhimmel. Dies bestand durch das ganze Zeitalter der Magie, das elfische Königreich wuchs und verehrte Sucellus.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Es bestand bis der Gott des Winters die Schöpfung betrat und Erebus in den unendlichen Winter warf. Faeryl, Königin des winterlichen Fürstenhofes, weigerte sich die Herrschaft vor Ende des Winters abzutreten. Die Elfen beteten um Hilfe und Sucellus antwortete, er stieg persönlich herab in die Schöpfung, um den Gott des Winters zu bekämpfen. Aber Sucellus wurde im Kampf getötet und seine Kinder wurden alleine und gottlos zurückgelassen.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Faeryl verfügte, dass die Anbetung eines toten Gottes sinnlos sei, und dass im Königreich stattdessen Esus gehuldigt werden sollte, dem Gott der Nacht und der Täuschung. Die Schreine des Sucellus wurden niedergerissen, die Priester die sich weigerten, ihren alten Glauben aufzugeben wurden aus dem elfischen Volk verstossen. Aber der Fürstenhof des Sommers stellte sich dagegen. Unter Arendel, Königin des sommerlichen Fürstenhofes, hoben sie eine Armee aus und griffen die Anhänger des winterlichen Fürstenhofes an - sie warfen die Elfen in einen blutigen Bürgerkrieg.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Als die Welt weiter abkühlte wegen der Anwesenheit von Mulcarn und dem Tod des Sucellus wurde es mehr und mehr lebensfeindlich. Mit der Zeit verblieben nur kleine voneineander abgeschnittene Enklaven, wo die Gruppen der Elfen überleben konnten. Durch den Bürgerkrieg und die Kälte wurden beide Seiten beinahe ausgelöscht. Letztlich machte der Winter Truppenbewegungen und Angriffe unmöglich und beide Seiten wurden gezwungen, ihren Krieg beizulegen.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Über 400 Jahre später wurde Mulcarn getötet und der Sommer kehrte zurück. Den überlebenden Generationen der Elfen wurde es wieder ermöglicht zu reisen, und sie hatten weder den Schattenwald nicht vergessen, ihr uraltes Heimatland, noch ihren Krieg, der noch nicht entschieden wurde. Nun treffen sie erneut im Schattenwald aufeinander und dies muss nun ausgespielt werden, wer die Elfen in dieser neuen Ära anführen wird.</German>
		<Italian>When Sucellus withdrew from Erebus his children were left to rule themselves. They decreed that they would be ruled by two queens, each for half of the year. One queen ruled the summer court and under her the elves nurtured beauty and art, and trained in the vigilant defense of their empire. The other queen ruled the winter court which was made up of the mischievous members of the fey kingdom, the tricksters, illusionists and those fond of laughter and nights spent dancing under the stars. It continued like this all through the Age of Magic, the elven empire grew and revered Sucellus.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]That lasted until the god of Winter entered creation and dropped Erebus into an unending winter. Faeryl, queen of the winter court, refused to abandon her throne for as long as winter remained. The elves prayed for help and Sucellus answered, coming personally into creation to battle the god of winter. But Sucellus was killed in that battle and his children were left alone and godless.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Faeryl ordered that the worship of a dead god was useless and that the empire should instead revere Esus, the god of night and deception. The shrines of Sucellus were torn down, the priests unwilling to abandon their old faith were rejected from the elven nation. But the summer court rallied against this. Under Arendel, queen of the summer court, they raised an army and attacked the members of the winter court dropping the elves into a bloody civil war.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]As the world continued to cool from the presence of Mulcarn and the death of Sucellus it became less and less habitable. In time only small isolated pockets remained where the bands of elves could survive. Between the civil war and the cold both sides neared extinction. Eventually the winter made travel and attacks impossible and both sides were forced to put aside their war.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Over 400 years later Mulcarn was killed and summer returned. The surviving generations of elves were able to travel again, and they have not forgotten the Umbrawood, their ancient homeland, or the war that has not been settled. Now they meet again within the Umbrawood and this war must be played out to see who will control the elves in this new age.</Italian>

		<English>Faeryl was laid to rest with the honors due an elven queen. Though many argued against a funeral for an enemy leader, Arendel had demanded it. As controversial as it had been no one questioned it now and the massive funeral was properly somber and respectful.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Of the former Svartalfar, all those that had sworn allegiance to the summer court were invited to attend. For the first time in two ages the Svartalfar and Ljosalfar united in a common task, even if it was to mourn the death of the winter queen. They stood up and eulogized her and Svartalfar and Ljosalfar alike shed tears for Faeryl. Even Arendel stood and spoke lovingly of her sister, the fallen queen.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]That night the funeral procession passed through the streets of Evermore as starlight glistened off of the silver and mithril coffin. As was tradition her coffin was displayed within the Temple of Leaves for the night and then moved to the hidden tomb used to house elven royalty in the morning. By then thousands of gifts were brought to the temple and laid around the tomb.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Just before dawn horns summoned all the citizens of Evermore to the city's grand plaza. Once everyone was gathered Arendel came out onto the palace balcony and addressed them.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"We must not forget. We must not forget our legends, the days spent within this very wood as the children of Sucellus and Cernunnos. We must not forget that age we spent on our own as a single elven nation and the trials and fortune we shared. And we must not forget that we turned to war with each other."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Every memory we have is shared, every glory, every defeat. We are one people, and we were even as we killed each other."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Long ago, Sucellus anointed two queens to lead us so that the passions of one person could not lead our empire into ruin as happened with the empire of men. But this split led to civil war."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Through prayer and careful deliberation with the priests, sages and captains of both former empires we have decided to form a new high council. That there would be two elven queens and an elven king to lead us. That these leaders would rule year round within their own nations and that they would come together to decide matters for the empire."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"I will be the queen of Evermore, of the temples and over the monuments and artifacts of our empire. I will tend to the orchards and provide for the musicians, artists and craftsmen. Brave Amelanchier will be anointed as king and assigned our army, given provision over our forts and made responsible for our defense. He will also take charge of our hunters and be responsible for the lands untended within our borders. Thessa will be anointed as queen and responsible for all manners of study, arcane or mundane, as well as diplomacy and trade with other lands. If military action is to occur outside of our empire then it will be under her leadership."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"If you are a child of Sucellus then you are a member of our empire. A particular faith is not a requirement and the former Svartalfar are equal in every way to other citizens. The war is over and if we are to shed tears then we must do so together. If we are angry then we must be angry with ourselves. As mighty Sucellus was destroyed by winter and split apart until Nantosuelta gathered his pieces back together for his resurrection, so are the Ljosalfar. Now rejoined we are reborn, and I pray that will ever be so."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]As dawn struck the plaza the Ljosalfar palace seemed to glow with an aura of gold and white. It was a new world for the Ljosalfar and they couldn't help but feel hopeful that it would be a kinder world than they had known for centuries.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]That night, after to coronation of Thessa and Amelanchier and seeing them off to their remote capitals Arendel retired to her personal chambers. After checking the magical wards that protected the rooms she removed her amulet and watched in the mirror as the illusion melted away. Her long blond hair shortened to wavy black. Her skin paled to cool alabaster. Her body shifted from the lean beautiful form of the elven queen to her own more sensual and curved body.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Far away, beneath the great red oak of Evermore, within the hidden tomb for elven royalty, behind powerful guards and locked within a silver and mithril box the real Arendel screamed.</English>

		<English>The messenger of Esus was one of my favorite creations. He had two mouths and always spoke both the truth and lies. He was currently standing before the court simultaneously telling of the victory of the Svartalfar and of the Ljosalfar. Demonic barons planned both my triumph and a way to recover from this defeat depending on which story they believed. Of course as I am able to discern every lie; it is of no hindrance to me.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The messenger addressed the masked figure in the throne, who sat in the deepest shadows of the long hall. Everyone assumed that was Esus, in fact my deception was so complete that even the decoy in the throne believed he was Esus when actually I was disguised as a simple lyrist in the hall. These past few centuries I had begun to wonder: what if everyone in the hall believed that they were Esus and I wasn't in fact the god of deception? But it was a thought I tried to chase out of my mind.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I could see everything done in shadows, hear everything whispered. In a distant cell Ljosalfar prisoners planned for an escape, Rivanna herself considered overthrowing Faeryl, and all throughout the Umbrawood those few elves who remained loyal to Cernunnos hid.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Across the rest of Erebus greater lies are being told by priests, generals and kings. I closed my eyes and buried myself in the layers of manipulation, intrigue and egoism.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]But there was one cancerous sore on Erebus, one place devoid of the subtleties of my work. The Dead Lands, where walking corpses spoke their own simple truth and Tebryn Arbandi sought to end my game entirely. There is no opportunity in destruction, and as much as my wayward sister may object, I had no desire to see my kingdoms turned to ash.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]So I whispered into Faeryl's ear. I told her tales of desire, wealth and power and beneath a white moon the Svartalfar launched warships towards the Dead Lands.</English>

		<Italian>The messenger of Esus was one of my favorite creations. He had two mouths and always spoke both the truth and lies. He was currently standing before the court simultaneously telling of the victory of the Svartalfar and of the Ljosalfar.

Of course as I am able to discern every lie; it is of no hindrance to me.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The messenger addressed the masked figure in the throne, who sat in the deepest shadows of the long hall. Everyone assumed that was Esus, in fact my deception was so complete that even the decoy in the throne believed he was Esus when actually I was disguised as a simple lyrist in the hall. These past few centuries I had begun to wonder: what if everyone in the hall believed that they were Esus and I wasn't in fact the god of deception? But it was a thought I tried to chase out of my mind.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I could see everything done in shadows, hear everything whispered. In a distant cell Ljosalfar prisoners planned for an escape, Rivanna herself considered overthrowing Faeryl, and all throughout the Umbrawood those few elves who remained loyal to Cernunnos hid.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Across the rest of Erebus greater lies are being told by priests, generals and kings. I closed my eyes and buried myself in the layers of manipulation, intrigue and egoism.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]But there was one cancerous sore on Erebus, one place devoid of the subtleties of my work. The Dead Lands, where walking corpses spoke their own simple truth and Tebryn Arbandi sought to end my game entirely.

		<English>Flauros had come to observe the progress Decius was making, and they consulted over dinner. Decius was eating the last stores of an elven city recently conquered, as it was getting harder to find decent food as Hyborem's corruption spread. Flauros merely sipped his imported wine. A fire crackled as they discussed the final battle plans, causing shadows to dance on the castle's walls.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]One of the shadows detached itself, however, and dove towards Decius, knives in each hand. One pierced the warrior's side, and he fell from his chair. Flauros watched calmly as Decius rolled aside and removed the knife. The wound wasn't bad, due to his light armor. The assassin lunged again, and Decius barely moved aside. He grabbed the man's arm and swung him into the wall, stunning him with a sickening crunch.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Flauros pushed himself back from the table and rose. "Very well done, my friend. With this invader as well as the entire Tempus Mor gambit. They say the best revenge is living well. I think you've earned the gift. Take this man's dying blood and I will show you the ritual we use to prolong our lives."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Decius gazed at the cloaked man for a moment, then drew his blade and plunged it into the assassin's heart. Flauros smiled, but Decius cut him off with a "No."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"You are refusing the gift?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Yes, I am. If I were to live forever, I might end up like you. Weak and soft."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]His patron replied by picking up the assassin and tearing his head off with his bare hands.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Decius continued, "You have physical strength, but you take it for granted. The cunning hunter has become the fat and lazy shepherd. Your immortality makes you content to sit back and let the world pass you by. I have walked alongside death and am not ready to abandon him now; I need this foe to keep my reflexes sharp and my plans focused.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Flauros studied Decius for a moment, then replied, "You no longer amuse me. I am returning to Prespur. You may do as you wish with those who will follow you, but do not return to my city on pain of death."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Decius watched Flauros left, then smiled to himself. He turned to the dead assassin and said, "Now, that's a useful trick you have. Wonder if there are any more like you?"</English>

		<English>Ethne stood again in the infirmary. People of many nations lay around her: Elven warriors, Sheaim prisoners of war, Malakim soldiers, religious pilgrims from around the world. Many, many more had passed through here since she had decided to deviate from the Elohim philosophy. A terror had been unleashed, and no doubt her name would be cursed by widows and orphans as Basium took his armies into all lands where the Ashen Veil reached. But her people had been saved, as had a core remnant of her allies. She had regrets, but life presented no paths free of regrets, and her Mercurian alliance was a choice she would again make.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"It will not be too much longer, Tuatha," she said to the monk who had been her shadow in the years of the war of Tempus Mor.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Yes, my liege, there have been many fewer injured of our forces in the last months. And even fewer of the enemy killed or injured. Reports from Decius have been positive on his front as well, and the Ljosalfar refugees are eager to return."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Ethne nodded. "This war may draw to an end soon, and we can tend to the people and land so harmed in it."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"You have done enough." The voice came out of nowhere.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"This is a restricted area. If you have grievances-"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"You cannot restrict us." This time the voice was from the other side of them. Ethne and Tuatha backed towards the hall. Other monks rose from tending the wounded and came to aid Ethne.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It was to no avail. She backed into a cloaked man and before she had a chance to turn and see him his blade protruded from her chest. Tuatha grabbed the invader and threw him against the stone wall, then readied his mace and rushed towards him, but the assassin rolled past and into the hall, dashing away. When Ethne's protectors chased after, they found nothing.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Tuatha called for the castle arch-mage, but knew it would be to no use. He felt the theft of Ethne's spirit-resurrection would be no use.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"We must contact Decius. There may be other targets."</English>

		<English>Decius directed his army to set up his camp on the foothills of Tempus Mor. The war had been long, and had hardened the Malakim recruits he led, but they stayed true to the Empyrean ideals, and had spared some remnant of his allies' civilizations. The eternal feud between Basium and the Infernals was sure to spread like fire to the rest of the world, as reports came in of Hellfire gates opening in distant lands through the actions of Sheaim agents.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]But Tempus Mor would have peace, and Varn's vision of an alliance of the good nations had borne fruit. Decius set a guard and headed into his tent to plot his next action. After some time he fell asleep on the ground beside his maps.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Late into the night he was awoken by a shout from his guard. As he rose he saw, from nowhere, an assassin's arm, dagger readied. Battle-hardened reflexes saved Decius's life, and he disarmed the assassin only to watch him begin to fade from view again. Whether this was some demon or wizard, Decius knew he had better find out who sent him. He grabbed a torch and swung it at the intruder to disrupt his spell. The assassin, a human man cloaked in grey, fell to the ground screaming and Decius's guards were able to subdue him.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Interrogation revealed an iron will in the assassin, but he was able to rule out the Svartalfar, Infernals, and Calabim as a source. As he mulled over how to get a motive out of his would-be killer, a messenger arrived. An Elohim monk with word that Ethne the White had succumbed to a similar strike, and magic was useless to revive her. If the Elohim ruler was to be restored, her assailant must be tracked down. And ignoring this threat would surely lead to future attempts, which might pierce his defenses. He had hoped to reinforce a city called Bourne the Gleaming, founded by Empyrean missionaries sent shortly after the first council in the desert of Myrh. But this mission south, into the wastes, took priority. With the secrets of the Mercurian Gate that Ethne had given them, they may be able to hold out against the Infernals summoned from the Hell-fire in lands of Os-Gabellas Sheaim ally, Tebryn. </English>

As he rose he saw, from nowhere, an assassin's arm, dagger readied. Battle-hardened reflexes saved Decius's life, and he disarmed the assassin only to watch him begin to fade from view again. Whether this was some demon or wizard, Decius knew he had better find out who sent him. He grabbed a torch and swung it at the intruder to disrupt his spell. The assassin, a human man cloaked in grey, fell to the ground screaming and Decius's guards were able to subdue him.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Interrogation revealed an iron will in the assassin, but he was able to rule out the Svartalfar, Infernals, and Calabim as a source. As he mulled over how to get a motive out of his would-be killer, a messenger arrived. An Elohim monk with word that Ethne the White had succumbed to a similar strike, and magic was useless to revive her. If the Elohim ruler was to be restored, her assailant must be tracked down. And ignoring this threat would surely lead to future attempts, which might pierce his defenses. He had hoped to reinforce a city called Bourne the Gleaming, founded by Empyrean missionaries sent shortly after the first council in the desert of Myrh. But this mission south, into the wastes, took priority. With the secrets of the Mercurian Gate that Ethne had given them, they may be able to hold out against the Infernals summoned from the Hell-fire in lands of Os-Gabellas Sheaim ally, Tebryn. </German>

The war had been long, and had hardened the Malakim recruits he led, but they stayed true to the Empyrean ideals, and had spared some remnant of his allies' civilizations.

		<English>Os-Gabella stalked alone, appraising the hellish landscape that greeted their progress here. This was once a forest, perhaps even an elven town, though little remained to suggest it. She stooped down and picked up a skull, then let it drop from her fingers. The Infernals' handiwork. There was a certain beauty to the emptiness that made her wistful. Her plan was a long-term one, and while she was well suited for patience, she longed for rest. "So far to go..." she muttered, dropping the skull.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"You've gone far enough." Os-Gabella whirled to see the speaker, a cloaked human man with a blade already poised to strike. She did not try to stop him. The strange hunter feinted and spun, impaling her heart in the blink of an eye."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Alas. I hadn't expected you would succeed." She grasped his head and began chanting. A moment later his body fell to the charred field, his head residing in a separate plane altogether.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]When Os-Gabella returned to Galveholm, the captain of her spies was waiting for her. "Interesting news, milady. Ethne the White of the Elohim has been slain."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Death is ubiquitous, or so I'm told."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Her archmages were unable to resurrect her. Apparently her assassin has a blade which could send her soul straight to the next world."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Os-Gabella inhaled sharply. "Contact Decius. Offer him whatever he names if he retrieves this sword. Meanwhile, the chaos spreads. Already Infernal forces are coming to aid our Arch-mage ally Tebryn. They will surely defeat the Empyrean stronghold of Bourne the Gleaming, as is has been riddled from within by corruption. And all across Erebus, our war will spill. Come, end of all things. Bring me release."</English>

		<English>Decius was waiting impatiently for the Emissary from the Ashen Veil to discuss strategy. Ritualists still made him uneasy. "Hello, Decius."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Decius turned. There was a horseman greeting the Calabim leader that he did not recognize, until he removed his helm. "Rosier. You survived, then? I had thought the Order's hounds would have found you."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The fallen Oath-taker dismounted. "You'd be surprised what you can survive when you lose all limits. Or perhaps you wouldn't." Rosier laughed. Decius didn't. Rosier continued, "Once we defeat the Overcouncil, the Ashen Veil should have enough strength to challenge even the Bannor."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"I thought the Ashen Veil cared more for the slow corruption method?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Once we get the power we need, we can carry the torch to our enemies more openly. The Bannor are a dry husk of hypocrisy ready to be set ablaze. Can we count on your support when that battle comes?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"I think you get ahead of yourself. The Mercurians are a mortal threat to you unless we cripple them here and to the West, where they try to build a second gate with the help of the Radiant Guard. Should we prevail... I do not consider the Bannor worth mercy. I was betrayed. But I don't consider revenge my goal, Rosier, nor destruction. If your plans strengthen me, I will be there."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Rosier nodded, and their talk turned to strategy.</English>

		<English>He found her in the infirmary. There were many among them who were skilled in healing arts; the Elohim temples and medical colleges were the most advanced in the world. So Ethne was not tending to the wounded directly, but rather to those so caught up in their work that they neglected themselves. She brought food to healers who were caring for the diseased, blankets for monks who had passed out exhausted among the burned or catatonic, and wiped away tears from priestesses caring for the maimed.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]As his shadow fell over her, Ethne turned and rose to face Einion. "Did you think you could deceive me?" he asked her.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Ethne bowed her head. "Deception is not a skill I posses, dear Logos. I merely neglected to consult about this course of action. Please do not take it as a sign of disrespect."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Einion tapped his staff sharply on the ground, making an echo through the stone hall. "You are too coy child. I had to find out from Valoel, after he had already begun construction. Surely some madness has gripped you!"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Have you another plan? If so, I have not heard it. Os-Gabella has refused our ambassadors, and the Infernal reception was far worse. The Winter Queen has promised to bring peace to the forests, even as the people of Evermore are sold as slaves."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"The lands that we have lost are unimportant. We can have the peace to continue our mission of preservation if we realize what is important. In these times of war, it is all the more important that we seek to save the knowledge that has been gained since the dawn of the Age. We have no need of these barbaric 'heavenly' warriors! As it was written in the times of our ancestors, 'Let virtue be your spear and faith your shield.'"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Ethne turned her gaze around the room filled with burned pilgrims and their maimed defenders. "Which of these lacked virtue, then, and which lacked faith?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Einion was silent a moment, but not long enough for Ethne to think she swayed him. "A great many more will be so afflicted, and due to your actions our hands will be awash in the blood of the next victims. What you do here you do without my blessing. Oh great Sirona, why have I lived so long to see us come to this?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Ethne bowed her head respectfully as Einion retreated, then said softly, "If you live any longer, honored friend, it will be due to the warriors of heaven you so deplore."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The gate was built. It was everything Einion feared and everything Ethne prayed.</English>

		<English>Decius watched the armies of the allied Malakim tribes array into a rough formation, each man with his arms and near his kin. There was much squabbling and joking; far from the ordered troops he had commanded on Bannor crusade. "They are not prepared for what we face, Vaughn."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"We haven't embarked on a religious war before. We have no hardened crusaders among us. I count this a point in favor of the Empyrean, do you not?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"I do not count naïveté as a virtue when I march to war. Fanaticism is a vice I do not wish to import, but martial discipline will be critical if any of these men are to return."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Vicar frowned. "It would be good if we could stay longer in this desert, where we have the advantage. But if our council is to sustain us in our hard times, we must stand with the Elohim in their dark hour."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Indeed. I would prefer to train them more, but what Varn Gosam tells me is cause for immediate mobilization. There is a dark and secretive people known as the Sheaim, and their schemes have reached fruition with an Infernal Pact. Agaress archangel Hyborem has entered our world. He has struck against the Ljosalfar, allowing our old enemies the Svartalfar an advantage in their war. The Elohim have brought in another ally, a force for good but not for peace-the renegade Basium and his warriors. Weakness in this war will bring destruction to the forces of good."</English>

He turned to his queen, seated in her throne gazing impassively at the magic circle in the dim candle light.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"I cannot say that this will grant you what you seek, milady."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"No, likely it will not. Hyborem's powers are great indeed, but even he lacks the power to rescind a blessing given by the twenty-one in concert. It seems I am destined to see the end of this world."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"If anything would bring the apocalypse upon our world, it would be this ritual. Agares's followers will be bound to this world..." She trailed off as a sudden shaking almost knocked her to her feet. "Milady! Are we besieged?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Abnoba... foolish child, what did you expect the rearrangement of the universe to feel like? Although doubtless the Bannor camp at our borders would take this as provocation and besiege us, and it would be to our advantage to let them face the Infernals and rip this land asunder... our spies tell us that they shall soon have to return home and face a worse surprise in the halls of Torrolerial. So we must find some other target for our new patron Hyborem."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Ashen Veil priestess smiled. "The north."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Os-Gabella beckoned. From the shadows came a Succubus. "If Hyborem has done his part from Hell, his forces should be emerging near Tempus Mor. The civil war of the Elven states should distract them enough for Hyborem to gain ground." The Succubus nodded and left the hall.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"And we?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Os-Gabella smiled. "As we have ever done.

		<English>A dusky lady in purple robes walked through the sandstorm outside the Calabim Palace. She was followed by a sand lion and a Malakim soldier holding a white banner of parlay. She was admitted to the forbidding antechamber of the palace by mocking guards, who brought her request for a meeting with their commander to Decius.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Decius allowed the meeting, and she was shown into his throne room. Her bodyguards and the bloodpets guarding the entrance were the only other people there. Decius said, "You are lucky that I am leading this force, lady. My patrons would not have so honored an enemy they had the advantage of. So you may speak, but I have a limit to my patience as well."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The lady nodded. "I am Talia Gosam, druid, and I come on behalf of the Overcouncil."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Decius raised an eyebrow. "I had thought that your council had learned the futility of its existence in the desert of Myrh. Or were you absent during the sacking of Golden Leane?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"We all stand as long as one stands, and I trust you are not so foolish as to count this conflict won already. We are prepared to discuss terms with the Calabim separate from your allies."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Terms?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Talia said, "Our guide and god Lugus despises you and your wicked kin, but surely even you can see the threat posed by the Sheaim and the Infernals to the entire world! Your support for them is preventing our stopping this threat."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"What about the Svartalfar?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"We would happily leave them out of this, or negotiate with them while we focus on the Infernals, but the past has proven that deals struck with Faeryl Viconia are unreliable. We can only hope that you have some measure of wisdom and honor despite your cruelty."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Cruelty? You don't know me, Talia. I am not the monster you might expect, although you will find such among my ranks, and my patrons. But I have as little use for cruelty as I do for honor. Your terms won't give me what I've already been promised, and I need not submit to righteous guardians in the process. Surely a druid understands the need to control one's own life, whatever the consequences?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Speak not to me of my calling! You are allied with those who destroy the natural order wherever they step and would set the world aflame. There is redemption for you, Decius, if you will take it, but the Sheaim must be stopped. For the sake of all life! Think of this. Repent, and the Overcouncil will ensure your survival. That is all." Talia turned and left, returning unharmed to the Malakim forces.</English>
		<French>A dusky lady in purple robes walked through the sandstorm outside the Calabim Palace. She was followed by a sand lion and a Malakim soldier holding a white banner of parlay. She was admitted to the forbidding antechamber of the palace by mocking guards, who brought her request for a meeting with their commander to Decius.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Decius allowed the meeting, and she was shown into his throne room. Her bodyguards and the bloodpets guarding the entrance were the only other people there. Decius said, "You are lucky that I am leading this force, lady. My patrons would not have so honored an enemy they had the advantage of. So you may speak, but I have a limit to my patience as well."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The lady nodded. "I am Talia Gosam, druid, and I come on behalf of the Overcouncil."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Decius raised an eyebrow. "I had thought that your council had learned the futility of its existence in the desert of Myrh. Or were you absent during the sacking of Golden Leane?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"We all stand as long as one stands, and I trust you are not so foolish as to count this conflict won already. We are prepared to discuss terms with the Calabim separate from your allies."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Terms?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Talia said, "Our guide and god Lugus despises you and your wicked kin, but surely even you can see the threat posed by the Sheaim and the Infernals to the entire world! Your support for them is preventing our stopping this threat."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"What about the Svartalfar?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"We would happily leave them out of this, or negotiate with them while we focus on the Infernals, but the past has proven that deals struck with Faeryl Viconia are unreliable. We can only hope that you have some measure of wisdom and honor despite your cruelty."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Cruelty? You don't know me, Talia. I am not the monster you might expect, although you will find such among my ranks, and my patrons. But I have as little use for cruelty as I do for honor. Your terms won't give me what I've already been promised, and I need not submit to righteous guardians in the process. Surely a druid understands the need to control one's own life, whatever the consequences?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Speak not to me of my calling!

		<English>Decius returned to Golden Leane for the latest Overcouncil meeting. He was well used to his life, leading an army from the front lines, but he would enjoy sleeping in a bed, and the warmth of the desert. This winter seemed to be particularly harsh.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]On the road he was surprised to see a small company of the palace guard at an oasis. Then he noticed a woman meditating in the underbrush. He sent his personal guard ahead, and approached her.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"I thought that you had a garden at the palace for this," he said once she noticed him.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Talia smiled and rose. "Sometimes I need something a bit more wild. Varn was kind enough to assign his palace guard to keep watch for intruders, but it isn't needed. The wilds will guard me. Protection isn't what I need from my husband."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The two turned and began walking back towards the capital, the guardsmen following respectfully behind. "I have not met a druidess, before, milady, but I am surprised that you are drawn to the desert."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Talia smiled and accepted the change of subject. "The dunes and barren rocks hold no joy for me, but here and there, in oases such as this, one find plants and animals of unequaled tenacity and cunning. This is nature as beautiful as any verdant elven forest, and this is the nature that I fell in love with when I first came to this desert. These are the same qualities that I saw in Varn, and you as well, Decius."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Tenacity? I have fled from my home rather than face false charges and defend my name honorably."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Honorable rabbits do not long survive hawks.

		<Spanish>A Svartalfar spy was waiting in Os-Gabella's chambers when she retired for the night. "This game of Faeryl's may intimidate some, but it merely annoys me to have to kill so many of her spies," Os-Gabella said.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"I come with a message, dear friend of the Svartalfar. An opportunity. A tale of conversation overheard in the palace of a another friend. The wife of Varn Gosam, a woman of greatly divergent temperament, requests the Calabim withdrawal from our alliance. Decius declines the offer, overly politely. There is more here than diplomacy. A risk that Decius may be swayed, but as far as he has come, he has scant recourse to go back. If she were to have a moment of weakness though, it would stab at the heart of the Overcouncil."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Os-Gabella smiled. "Perhaps if we alienate Decius... make him lonely, to long for a companion, he would seek out this woman in the future. Make sure he knows his fortune depends on his allegiance to us, however."</Spanish>

		<English>The Calabim hunters returned with unexpected prey from their patrol into the savannah at the edge of the desert of Myrh. Decius went out to meet them when they returned, to hear the reports from the Calabim's eastern front. He found the patrol stripping a woman. There was a sand lion corpse next to her that they had brought back as a trophy. Decius started to turn away; obviously there was nothing urgent to report. But he caught a glimpse of the woman's face.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Stop." The vampire hunter who held the woman didn't notice the command, though his peers stood aside. Decius shoved him roughly aside. "I said stop."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The hunter snarled. His hand twitched by the handle of his axe, but his discipline held. He stepped back and said, "This is my spoils, commander. We found this wildling at an oasis, alone but for this beast here, which I killed. Let me take her."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"This is no ordinary witch-woman; she is a Malakim noble. You will be rewarded for her bounty price. Was there anything else to report?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"No commander. The settlements we had heard of have been abandoned."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Decius had Talia bound and taken to his tent. Shortly he returned there himself. He freed her bonds, but made a show of pointing out the silhouettes of his armed guards outside his tent.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Surprising to see you again," he said. "Were you on another diplomatic quest?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"No. I was meditating. The cries of the natural order were agonizing, and I was distracted and subdued by your hunter. Thank you for your intervention."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"It seemed a wasteful use of someone of your caliber."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"So what use do you have in mind?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Decius studied her for a moment. "I haven't decided. Were I to follow the ways of my adopted people, I would take what pleasures your body offers and feast on your soul. Oddly, perhaps, this holds no appeal for me, and has the downside of wasting the resource of your mind. If I would take the example of the Bannor, I would try to discern the strength of your character and fidelity of your faith, then damn or free you based on that. While good for keeping discipline, I don't see my gain in that, either."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"You have lived among the Bannor?" Talia said. "I have heard they are a people of unequaled zeal."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Yes. And blind devotion, unending war, and arrogance dressed up as virtue."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Talia crossed her arms and gazed at the ground. "I fear my Varn leads us down this path as well. He brings the Malakim into conflicts that were not ours and ignores the wisdom others bring to meetings now devoted to Lugus. He has lost balance."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"I would not be so ungrateful for advisors such as you. My allies have seen fit to give me Ritualists and mages to consult, magi who think little of my interests or that of my empire. I know you care little for my survival, but at least you would be honest about it."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"I would never aid you while you side with the Infernal."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"They do seem to be making a mess of these lands I would claim, but I cannot oppose them now. And your little Overcouncil is too weak to win at this point. Perhaps I can peacefully keep them from my empire, or gather allies to strike them in secret at a time of my choosing."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Do you think that my husband will let you detain me for your own use?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Decius shrugged. "It doesn't seem he was keeping a very close eye on you. Here is my decision, then. When Varn Gosam requests your return, you may leave unharmed. If you wish to give me your voice, or any other aid, I will welcome it."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"You are kinder than I would have thought." Grudging respect was all Decius gained from Talia at first, but over the coming weeks she opened up to him, as he kept news of her capture a secret from ally and foe alike. She came to admire his strength and cunning, and bask in his attention. Finally, thoughts of her home and cause slipped entirely from her, and she embraced her captor.</English>

		<English>Talia walked unescorted from the Calabim borders through the savannah. It was early morning, and she headed towards the rising sun, towards home. Decius had just released her from a captivity that she had forgotten wasn't voluntary. He had fascinated her, and she had betrayed her husband Varn Gosam to her baser instincts. But she learned much of the man whose armies opposed hers, and she comforted herself with the thought that this information might aid her people in stopping the Calabim.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Do you know how the Sea of Sorrow was named?" The voice came from the shadows of a rock formation as she passed by.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Who's there? I have been granted passage as a prisoner exchange by Decius of the Calabim."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]An old crone in dusty purple robes emerged from the shadows. "There once was a great king who ruled over this land. Lord of all he would survey. His palace stood on a cliff overlooking the sea on the western edge." She paused.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Talia gave her no further prompting. "I have no time for your story. I am too long delayed from my home already." She turned away and hurried on, but found the woman ahead of her.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"It is his sorrow from which this sea draws its name. A great king who had everything he asked for given. And he climbed the tower stairs to throw himself to his death in the crashing sea beneath."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"What concern is this of mine? Kings come and go; all creatures suffer. I must return to my people, who struggle with a threat to every living thing under the sun!" The dust around her feet rose swirling around her, cutting off the old woman, and again Talia turned towards home.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]This time she saw the woman step from thin air in front of her. "What caused a sorrow so great to make him disdain his own life? Do you not know the story?" The Crone looked into Talia's eyes, who this time held her gaze. "That which he most treasured was shown to be false. A promise shown a lie. A wife shown untrue."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Spirit be gone! Do not... do not judge me."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"The king's greatest desire was for his trusted queen to stand loyally by his side and help him to rule justly. He was too kind to send her away, too wise to trust her again, too idealistic to live with his dream out of reach. His death was the only solution within his grasp."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"It would be better had he never learned of this," Talia said softly.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"He will learn of it," the Crone said.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"He should... he can take another."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"He is too true to do that. The king could not be happy... not while the queen who betrayed him still lived."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The old woman turned away, releasing Talia from her gaze. Talia shook her head, then turned away, running towards home.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The crone's ancient façade faded away. She removed a small mirror from her robes, and sprinkled a powder over it, revealing a dreary castle in a hellish landscape. "The seeds are planted, Lethe. Follow this one. Take her guilt and pain as supplication, and lead her to your embrace."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Then after one final look to the fleeing Talia, Os-Gabella spoke a arcane command and returned to her palace.</English>

		<English>The Malakim soldiers fell silent when they saw who came into their war camp. Heads were bowed before Varn Gosam, the elf who had united them and shown them the light of their purpose. Varn Gosam smiled, speaking briefly with a few men before making his way to Decius's tent.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Decius looked up when Varn entered. He paused a moment, then said, "Varn, welcome. It is good to see you here. You should be safe, the tide of battle favors us, and seeing you will lift morale."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Yes, that is so. I will be sure to speak to them before leaving. But I came because I had to see you in person. I have a task to charge you with," Varn said.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Much depends on the task I face here, my friend. I should not leave it until complete."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"You have served well, in your official capacity, and I must ask for more of you. I am stepping down, for a while, at least. I have taken too much upon myself. Our goals are great, and require great effort. But they are so great they are beyond any one man, and as we have set the wheels in motion I must take some time for my own life."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Then my role?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Take the lead of the Malakim. You have made an excellent general, and the men of the desert honor you for your skills and devotion. For a while, I ask that you guide the civil affairs of our people as well. Have a mage attend you, and use divination to communicate with the council in Golden Leane. This will take some of your time from here, but you should have competent commanders you can promote to lead from the front."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Decius nodded. "I will do this for you. So you will devote yourself to Lugus's work on the Overcouncil?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"No. Chalid has been attending the council meetings with me, and he shall take over as Speaker in my stead. Vaughn will return to Dies Dei and take the mantle of Patriarch."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Very well. May I ask what prompted this retirement?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Varn shook as head and turned to leave, then paused with his back to Decius. "We preach openness, I so suppose it should not go unsaid. Your recent actions when my Talia was visiting here have demonstrated how much I was failing my other obligations. It was my hubris to think that I could cause no harm while pursuing the good with such dedication. The same mistake made by the priesthood that so failed you, I suppose. The marital bond that sustained me I neglected; now I must see if it can be made strong anew. Take care, Decius, and take care of my people."</English>

Your recent actions when my Talia was visiting here have demonstrated how much I was failing my other obligations. It was my hubris to think that I could cause no harm while pursuing the good with such dedication. The same mistake made by the priesthood that so failed you, I suppose.
