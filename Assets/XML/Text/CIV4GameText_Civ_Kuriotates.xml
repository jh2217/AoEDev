Squabbling tribes, clans, warlords and embryonic city-states were gathered into a small nation led by the boy-king Cardith Lorda. It is in this background that we find the secret behind the Kuriotates' rather odd societal structure. All these diverse elements gathered together in a sheltered and bountiful land, and started to forge a state that could survive in a dangerous world. However, the mutual distrust between all the clans, families and dynasties Cardith Lorda brought together means that they will not suffer another to grow more powerful than they are. In effect, the lower levels of government in the core regions are marked by a form of democracy, watched over by a royal administration with complete control.[PARAGRAPH:1]Thus, all expansion is conducted by the King, and by him alone, and all territory is royal territory. The army swears allegiance to the king alone, and all administrative functions flow from the state rather than a master-servant system. There is no feudal system among the Kuriotates. The powerful live in the cities, and compete for positions there. In the outlying areas, the powerful are only powerful by royal decree, and Cardith Lorda's careful machinations ensures that it stays that way. Thus arose the system of settlements.[PARAGRAPH:1]The Kuriotates are a confederation of peoples and races, marked by a very powerful core region, vast areas more loosely connected to the core cities, and full freedom of asylum, even citizenship, for those who wish to move from other nations or the wilderness of uncivilized territory. The settlements, controlled solely by the central administration (i.e., Cardith Lorda's government) act as administrative centers, tying vast areas, often with their own highly advanced semi-autonomous indigenous populations, into the Kuriotate confederacy. The settlements provide facilities for transit, trade, administration and diplomacy in the affiliated regions, but never develop a very large population of pure Kuriotates. They are mostly populated by bureaucrats, merchants, a handful of soldiers and their families and the most promising born here quickly relocate to the central cities. A system of trade and friendship with their centre on the small Kuriotate settlements keeps the hodge-podge of allies, protectorates, semi-autonomies and client states happy and ensures that much-needed resources continue to flow to the core lands.[PARAGRAPH:1]The vast areas with sparse human population that get locked within the Kuriotates' disproportionately large sphere of influence and cultural domination mean that they get in contact with many of the rarer species of Erebus. For many civilizations, that might prove problematic, even act as a source of conflict and destruction. For the Kuriotates, it is a boon, and a source of their strength.[PARAGRAPH:1]For the Kuriotates don't much care who you are as long as you have something meaningful to offer to the nation as a whole. The Kuriotates' particularly positive relationship to the non-human species of Erebus dates back to the very beginnings of the confederation, when a small group of centaurs aided Cardith Lorda in his rise to power. Other creatures, attracted by the special power they detect in the boy king, have since flocked to the Kuriotate banner, escaping marginalization or even persecution in other parts of the world. The centaurs, having risen to be a force to be reckoned with in Kuriotate political life, smooth their transition and integration into the society, putting their special skills to good use in the areas at which they excel, through innate ability or cultural conditioning.[PARAGRAPH:1]The culture of the Kuriotates is such that the demi-humans are treated as, and indeed regarded as being, equal to the human majority, and judged by merit and benefit to the nation alone, although the fundamental differences between the races mean that some measure of distinction is necessary in order to allow the Kuriotate nation to run smoothly. However, again this may be a secret benefit.[PARAGRAPH:1]This specialization and segregation has given rise to something akin to a caste system, another reason the Kuriotates have such a stable central government. While the humans are the jack of all trades, each of the races has found its own niche. The centaurs, the warrior caste, hold many high positions in the army, the lamia wield great magical power, and command respect among the magi, and so on. Since all these subcultures owe allegiance to the king alone, they act, in their specialized roles, as an effective bulwark against the ambitions of human noblemen.[PARAGRAPH:1]Those few dissidents who let their resentment at being bypassed be channeled into irrational hatred of demi-humans are held in check by strong personal trust in Cardith Lorda and an emphasis on the state religion, not to mention state superstition and traditions.

		<Italian>[TAB]I Kuriotate possono avere solo un numero limitato di città, ma tali città hanno una maggiore produttività grazie a un'area di terreno sfruttabile più grande del normale. Le città fondate dopo aver raggiunto il limite di città diventano degli [LINK=CONCEPT_SETTLEMENTS]Insediamenti[\LINK].[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]Origine:[\H1][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Il nucleo dei Kuriotate si formò durante i terribili anni tra la fine dell'Era del Ghiaccio e l'inizio dell'Era della Rinascita. Diverse tribù, clan, signori della guerra e città-stato in fase embrionale furono riunite in una piccola nazione guidata dal re ragazzo Cardith Lorda. Ed è in questa loro origine che troviamo il motivo della struttura sociale abbastanza insolita dei Kuriotates. Tutti questi elementi diversi furono radunati tutti in una terra protetta e ricca di risorse, e iniziarono a forgiare uno stato che sarebbe stato capace di sopravvivere in un mondo pericoloso. Tuttavia, la diffidenza reciproca tra i clan, le famiglie e le dinastie che Cardith Lorda aveva unito significava che una di loro non avrebbe mai tollerato che le altre crescesserò più di loro. Nella pratica, le forme di governo delle regioni centrali sono contrasegnate da una sorta di democrazia, sorvegliate da un'amministrazione regale con potere assoluto.[PARAGRAPH:1]Perciò, ogni espansione è condotta dal Re, e da lui soltanto, e tutti i territori sono di sua proprietà. L'esercito giura fedeltà soltanto al re, e tutte le funzioni amministrative sono ricoperte dallo stato piuttosto che da un sistema signore-servitore. Non vi è alcun sistema feudale tra i Kuriotate. I potenti che vivono in città competono per le cariche ivi presenti, mentre nelle regioni periferiche i potenti sono tali solo per decreto regale, e le accorte macchinazioni di Cardith Lorda fanno in modo che la situazione rimanga tale. Così è nato il sistema degli insediamenti.[PARAGRAPH:1]I Kuriotate sono una confederazione di popoli e razze, contradistinti da delle regioni centrali molto forti, da ampie aree vagamente collegate alle città principali e dalla piena libertà di asilo, persino la cittadinanza, per coloro che provengono da altre nazioni o dai territori selvaggi. Gli insediamenti, controllati solamente dall'amministrazione centrale (i.e., il governo di Cardith Lorda) fungono da centri amministrativi, collegano ampie aree, spesso con delle avanzate popolazioni indigene semi-autonome, alla confederazione Kuriotate. L'insediamento fornisce strutture per il transito, per il commercio, l'amministrazione e la diplomazia nelle regioni affiliate, ma non sviluppa mai una grande popolazione di puri Kuriotate. Sono abitati per la maggior parte da burocrati, mercanti e una manciata di soldati con le loro famiglie, e i nascituri più promettenti vengono rapidamente trasferiti alle città centrali. Un sistema di commercio e amicizia tra le zone centrali e gli insediamenti Kuriotate mantiene l'insieme di alleati, protettorati, semi-autonomie e stati clienti felici, e allo stesso tempo assicura un costante flusso di risorse, altamente richieste, verso le terre centrali.[PARAGRAPH:1]Le vaste aree con una popolazione umana sparsa che vengono racchiuse dalla sproporzionata sfera d'influenza, o dalla dominazione culturale, dei Kuriotates permette a questi ultimi di entrare in contatto con le razze più rare di Erebus. Per molte civiltà ciò può essere problematico, o persino una motivo di scontro e distruzione. Ma per i Kuriotate questo è un vantaggio, e la fonte della loro forza.[PARAGRAPH:1]In quanto i Kuriotate non si preoccupano di chi o cosa sei finché hai qualcosa di utile da offrire alla nazione nel suo intero. Le relazioni particolarmente positive dei Kuriotate nei confronti delle razze non umane di Erebus risalgono sino al primissimo inizio della confederazione, quando un piccolo gruppo di centauri aiutò Cardith Lorda nella sua ascesa al potere. Altre creature, attratte dallo speciale potere che percepivano nel re ragazzo, sono da allora accorse sotto lo stendardo Kuriotate, scappando dall'emarginazione o dalla persecuzione in altre parti di Erebus. I centauri, essendo diventati una forza da non sottovalutare nella vita politica dei Kuriotate, facilitano la loro transizione e integrazione nella società, mettendo a frutto le loro abilità speciali in campi in cui eccellono, che sia per via di un'abilità innata o di un condizionamento culturale.[PARAGRAPH:1]La cultura Kuriotate è tale che i simil umani vengono trattati, oltre che essere considerati, come uguali alla maggioranza umana, e vengono giudicati per il merito e i benefici che portano soltanto alla nazione, sebbene alcune differenze fondamentali tra le razze comportino delle misure di distinzione che sono necessarie per il corretto funzionamento della nazione Kuriotate. Questo può, comunque, essere un vantaggio segreto.[PARAGRAPH:1]Questa specializzazione e segregazione ha portato a un qualcosa di simile a un sistema a caste, il che è anche un'altro motivo della particolare stabilità del governo centrale Kuriotate. Mentre gli umani sono dei factotum, ognuna delle altre razze ha trovato la propria nicchia. I centauri, la casta dei guerrieri, ricoprono molte alte cariche nell'esercito, mentre i lamia, che possiedono un grande potere magico, e sono rispettati tra i maghi, e via dicendo. Siccome tutte queste sottoculture devono essere fedeli solo al re esse agiscono, nei loro ruoli specializzati, come un efficente baluardo contro le ambizioni dei nobili umani.[PARAGRAPH:1]I pochi dissidenti che permettono al loro risentimento di essere incanalato verso un odio irrazionale verso i simil umani vengono tenuti in riga da una forte fiducia personale riposta in Cardith Lorda e da un enfasi sulla religione di stato, senza dimenticare le superstizioni e tradizioni statali. Pochi Kuriotate osano ostacolare o  addirittura mettere in dubbio la volontà dello stato, la volontà dei popoli della confederazione e, soprattutto, la volontà del divino Re-Ragazzo.[PARAGRAPH:1]I Kuriotate hanno un'ampio controllo sul loro impero, ma i loro confini sono porosi, e quando sono in guerra agiscono spesso come una tartaruga, ripiegando dentro il guscio robusto delle loro terre centrali sino a quando non avranno radunato le forze per riprendersi ciò che hanno perduto. E cosi i Kuriotate, attraverso la loro aperturà verso gli altri, una forte autorità centrale e un'ampia ma non pesante sfera di influenza, hanno una flessibilità che molti loro avversari mancano. Loro sono senza dubbio un centro di illuminazione nell'oscurità di Erebus.</Italian>

		<English>[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Strategy: Playing as the Kuriotates, you will have a group of big cities producing everything in your empire. All the rest will serve mostly as buffer zones and as ways to grab resources. Cardith Lorda's adaptive trait enables him to tailor his economy should he choose to pursue a cottage strategy and benefit from unique town upgrades, enclaves, or a great person strategy and benefit from huge populations. When waging a war, you may want to raze cities a lot, since otherwise they'll become Settlements-and you can't build units in them to help hold them. When you need to defend far flung settlements, though, take advantage of their centaur unique units, which unlike other fast-moving units, benefit from defense bonuses.[PARAGRAPH:1]Your Adaptive trait also allows you to change your Philosophical trait into something else, and reconsider that choice every 100 turns, should you desire. Remember to choose carefully whether you want your new cities to become cities or settlements, as you only get a limited number of cities. In the late game, when rivals are out-producing you with their large numbers of cities, burn them down with your dragon, the strongest unit buildable.</English>
		<French>[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Stratégie : En jouant les Kuriotates, vous aurez un groupe de grandes villes produisant toute chose en votre empire. Tout le reste servira principalement comme zone tampon et comme façons de colleter les ressources. Considérez la stratégie des Personnages Illustres, car vous êtes l'une des rares civilisations les mieux adaptées à cela (ayant à la fois le trait Philosophe et le bâtiment Monument), et assurez-vous de fonder le Culte du Dragon pour entraver un peu plus vos ennemis. Lorsque vous menez une guerre, vous devriez peut être raser beaucoup de ville, sinon elles deviendront des Campements - et vous ne pouvez pas y construire d'unités pour les tenir.[PARAGRAPH:1]Votre trait Adaptatif vous permet de changer votre trait Philosophe en autre chose, et revoir votre choix tous les 100 tours, selon votre bon désir. Souvenez-vous de décider prudemment si vos nouvelles villes deviennent des cités ou des campements, car vous avez un nombre limité de villes.</French>

Wenn Sie Krieg führen, sollten sie die Städte eher niederbrennen, da sie sonst zu Siedlungen werden - und Sie keine Einheiten darin bauen können, um sie zu verteidigen.[PARAGRAPH:1]Ihre Eigenschaft Adaptiv erlaubt Ihnen auch, Ihre Eigenschaft Philosophisch zu einer anderen zu ändern, und diese Auswahl alle 100 Runden zu ändern, sollten Sie danach verlangen.

Il tratto Adattabile di Cardith Lorda gli permette di adeguare la sua economia nel caso scegliesse di perseguire una strategia di villette e di beneficiare da migliaramenti unici delle città e enclavi, o dal seguire una strategia dei grandi personaggi e beneficiare di una ingente popolazione. Quando in guerra potresti voler radere al suolo ogni città, in quanto se le catturi diventeranno degli Insediamenti, nei quali non puoi creare unità per mantenerli. Quando hai bisogno di difendere Insediamenti distanti però potresti usufruire delle loro unità uniche di centauri, le quali, contrariamente alle altre unità rapide, usufruiscono dei bonus difensivi.[PARAGRAPH:1]Il tuo tratto Adattabile ti permette inoltre di cambiare il tuo tratto Filosofico in qualcos'altro, e riconsiderare tale scelta ogni 100 turni, se lo desideri. Ricordati di scegliere attentamente quando fondi una nuova città se vuoi che diventì una città o un insediamento, in quanto puoi avere solo un numero limitato di città. A gioco inoltrato, quando i tuoi avversari ti superano nella produzione grazie al loro grande numero di città bruciagliele con il tuo drago, l'unità costruibile più forte di tutto il gioco.</Italian>
		<Spanish>[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Estrategia: Los jugadores Kuriotates juegan con un grupo de ciudades grandes produciendo de todo en sus imperios. El resto servirán mayormente como zonas tapón y para obtener recursos. Hay que considerar una estrategia de Grandes Personajes porque es una de las pocas civilizaciones mejor preparadas para ello (teniendo tanto el rasgo Filosófico como la construcción Memorial), y asegurarse de fundar el Culto del Dragón para tocar un poco a los enemigos. Si hay guerra, es preferible arrasar ciudades, ya que de otro modo se convertirán en asentamientos, y en ellos no se pueden construir unidades para ayudar a mantenerlos.[PARAGRAPH:1]El rasgo Adaptativo también permite cambiar el rasgo Filosófico por algún otro, y reconsiderar esa elección cada 100 turnos. Hay que elegir con cuidado a la hora de crear ciudades, cuales serán nuevas ciudades y cuales asentamientos, porque hay un número limite de ciudades para esta civilización.</Spanish>

		<English>[TAB]Cardith truly was a remarkable monarch, Gilcrass reflected as he watched the Boy-King play a game of chess with one of his advisors. Granted, he had the outward appearance of a ten-year-old boy, but he had knowledge far beyond his years. In fact, he had knowledge far beyond the years of most rulers. And he wasn't really ten years old. He'd looked like that since the day Gilcrass had joined the Guard as a young stallion, never reaching puberty, never experiencing his voice break, never growing hair on his chest, never finding an interest in the fairer sex or the temptations of marriage.[PARAGRAPH:1]Gilcrass felt vaguely content about that. If one was to say that the king did have a love, it was the people of his empire, and his marriage was to his throne. Cardith Lorda devoted all his time to the running of the great cities, the expansion of the settlements, the campaigns against barbarians and enemy states.[PARAGRAPH:1]He showed no nepotism, no corruption in favor of his family, no "personal favors" to people who had his ear. This had a simple explanation: Cardith was, as far as anyone could tell, an orphan. He had no family history and no-one recognized him as hailing from any famous noble families. The name meant nothing to anyone-Gilcrass half suspected he had made it up.[PARAGRAPH:1]And still, through force of personality, determination, wisdom and a bit of cunning, Lorda had forged a union out of the fractured principalities and city-states of the Kuriotates in an amazingly short time. The period of fighting and bloodshed had been brief and limited, and after it had followed a new age of power and prosperity for all the Kuriotates.[PARAGRAPH:1]Gilcrass trotted closer to the couple engaged in their battle of wits. Cardith was winning, as usual. He looked up at the sound of Gilcrass' approach and gave him an affectionate smile. Then he turned back to the board and calmly made a killing move.[PARAGRAPH:1]Despite all his care, all his calmness and all his good work for the Kuriotates, this cold, calculating side of Lorda, which could seemingly be switched on and off at will, disturbed Gilcrass, although he would never tell the king that to his face.[PARAGRAPH:1]It wasn't the only thing that worried him. When Lorda was called upon to pass a harsh judgment, fight a campaign or make a particularly unpleasant decision, his voice would subtly change, taking on a low, hissing undertone, and the hard, reptilian glint in Cardith's eyes, so out of place in his otherwise soft, boyish features, would become even more pronounced.[PARAGRAPH:1]When that happened, Gilcrass was truly afraid.</English>

		<German>[TAB]Cardith war tatsächlich ein bemerkenswerter Monarch, dachte sich Gilcrass, als er dem Kind-König zusah, wie er eine Partie Schach gegen einen seiner Berater spielte. Obwohl er das Aussehen eines zehn Jahre alten Buben hatte, überstieg sein Wissen das übliche dieses Alters bei weitem. Tatsächlich überstieg dieses Wissen auch dass der meisten anderen Herrscher. Und er war nicht wirklich zehn Jahre alt. Er hatte schon so ausgesehen seit dem Tag, als Gilcrass der Garde als junger Hengst beigetreten war. Er hatte nie die Pubertät erreicht, nie einen Stimmbruch erfahren, niemals war Haar auf seiner Brust gewachsen, und niemals hatte er sich für das schönere Geschlecht interessiert, oder war er zur Ehe verführt worden. [PARAGRAPH:1] Gilcrass war damit relativ zufrieden. Wenn jemand sagen würde, dass der König eine Liebe hätte, dann wäre es die zum Volk seines Reiches, und seine Ehe war die mit seinem Thron. Cardith Lorda verbrachte seine gesamte Zeit damit, die großen Städte, die Expansion der Siedlungen, und die Kriegszüge gegen Barbaren und feindliche Staaten zu führen.[PARAGRAPH:1]Er zeigte keinen Hang zur Vetternwirtschaft, keine Korruption seiner Familie zuliebe, keine "kleinen Gefallen" für Menschen, die ihm Rat gaben. Dafür gab es eine einfache Erklärung: Cardith war, soweit irgendjemand es sagen konnte, ein Weise. Er hatte keine Familiengeschichte, und niemand kannte ihn als Spross irgendeiner berühmten adligen Familie. Sein Name sagte niemandem etwas - Gilcrass vermutete halb, dass er ihn erfunden hatte.[PARAGRAPH:1] Und dennoch, durch die Kraft seiner Persönlichkeit, Bestimmtheit, Weisheit, und ein bisschen Gerissenheit, hatte Lorda in verblüffend kurzer Zeit die verschiedenen Herrschaften und Stadtstaaten der Kuriotates zu einer Einheit geschmiedet. Die Zeit des Kämpfens und Blutvergießens war kurz und beschränkt gewesen, und danach war ein neues Zeitalter der Macht und des Wohlhabens aller Kuriotates angebrochen.[PARAGRAPH:1]Gilcrass trat näher an das Paar in ihrem Kampf der Geister heran. Cardith war am gewinnen, wie üblich. Er sah auf, als er Gilcrass kommen hörte, und gab ihm ein flüchtiges Lächeln. Dann wandte er sich wieder dem Spiel zu, und machte ruhig einen tödlichen Zug.[PARAGRAPH:1]Trotz all seiner Sorge, seiner Ruhe, und all seiner guten Werke für die Kuriotates, beunruhigte diese kalte, kalkulierende Seite Lordas, die anscheinend beliebig an-, und abgedreht werden konnte, Gilcrass, auch wenn er dies dem König nie ins Gesicht sagen würde.[PARAGRAPH:1]Das war nicht das einzige, das ihm Sorgen machte. Wann immer Lorda gerufen wurde, um ein hartes Urteil zu sprechen, einen Kriegszug zu führen, oder eine besonders unangenehme Entscheidung zu treffen, gab es eine subtile Änderung in seiner Stimme, sie bekam dann einen tieferen, zischenden Unterton, und das kalte, reptilienähnliche Glänzen in Cardiths Augen, das so falsch am Platz war in seinen übrigen zarten, kindlichen Gesichtszügen, war noch deutlicher zu sehen.[PARAGRAPH:1]Wenn dies geschah, musste Gilcrass wahrlich mit der Angst kämpfen.</German>
		<Italian>[TAB]Cardith era veramente un monarca straordianario Gilcrass riflettè mentre osservava il Re-Ragazzo giocare una partita di scacchi con uno dei suoi consiglieri. Lui aveva l'apparenza di un bambino di dieci anni, ma possedeva una conoscenza che superava di gran lunga la sua età. In effetti aveva una conoscenza molto più grande della maggior parte dei sovrani. Ed effettivamente non aveva veramente dieci anni. Aveva quell'aspetto sin dal giorno in cui Gilcrass, come giovane stallone, era entrato nella Guardia, senza mai raggiungere la pubertà, senza subire il cambio della voce, rimanendo senza peli sul petto, senza mai provare interesse verso il gentil sesso o le tentazioni del matrimonio.[PARAGRAPH:1]Gilcrass rimase vagamente felice per ciò. Se vi era un qualcosa che il re amava era il popolo del suo impero, e la sua sposa era il trono. Cardith Lorda dedicava tutto il suo tempo alla gestione delle grandi città, all'espansione degli insediamenti e alle campagne militari contro i barbari e gli stati nemici.[PARAGRAPH:1]Non faceva alcun tipo di nepotismo, nessuna corruzione in favore della sua famiglia, nessun "favore personale" alle persone che gli erano vicine. Il motivo era semplice: Cardith era, per quanto sapevano tutti, un'orfano. Non aveva una storia familiare e nessuno lo aveva riconosciuto come discendente da qualche famosa famiglia nobiliare. Il suo nome non diceva niente a chiunque, Gilcrass sospettava che se lo fosse creato lui.[PARAGRAPH:1]Eppure, attraverso la sua forza di carattere, determinazione, saggezza e un pò di astuzia, Lorda forgiò un'unione tra diverse principalità e citta stato dei Kuriotate in un tempo straordinariamente breve. Il periodo dei combattimenti e degli spargimenti di sangue fù breve e limitato, e dopo di esso vi fù un'era di prosperità e potere per tutti i Kuriotate.[PARAGRAPH:1]Gilcrass si avvicinò ai due che erano immersi nella sfida di ingegno. Cardith stava vincendo, come al solito. Lui sollevò lo sguardo sentendo il suono degli zoccoli di Gilcrass e gli sorrise in modo affettuoso. Poi tornò a osservare la scacchiera e fece con calma la mossa finale.[PARAGRAPH:1]Nonostante tutte le sue attenzioni, tutta la sua calma e le buone cose che aveva fatto per i Kuriotate, questo lato freddo e calcolatore di Lorda, che sembrava poter essere acceso e spento a volontà, turbava Gilcrass, anche se però non glielo avrebbe mai detto in faccia.[PARAGRAPH:1]Non era l'unica cosa che lo turbava. Quando era necessario che Lorda passase una punizione severa, guidasse una campagna militare o dovesse prendere una decisione particolarmente spiacevole, la sua voce cambiava in maniera sottile, assumendo un sottotono basso e sibilante, e il duro sguardo da rettile degli occhi di Cardith, che era cosi fuori luogo nelle sue morbidi caratteristiche infantili, diventava ancora più pronunciato.[PARAGRAPH:1]Quando succedeva, Gilcrass ne rimaneva sinceramente spaventato.</Italian>

		<English>She had arrived while it was still dark, to watch and to consider, but now the whole eastern sky was splashed with salmon-colored clouds and beams of solid sunlight that stroked the valley floor. From here on Verdant Peak, she could see not just the city, but the whole plain, thick with waving grasslands and sprinkled here and there with forests. Springing down from the foothills of the mountains to the north was a great river. It twisted in wide loops across the green earth, while garlands of farms, orchards, vineyards, and pasturelands spread out on either side of it. At the mouth of the river the city itself, already bustling with activity, sprawled across the delta and rose to gleaming heights: Kwythellar, the City of Refuge.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Yakut sat on the watch-seat of Verdant Peak and pondered. She came here often; once a month or more, to consider her people and her city, to plan their future, and to gain perspective on the sufferings and triumphs of the Kuriotates. She sometimes felt trapped within the vast city, but a day at the peak would clear her mind. Perhaps it was her equine nature that chafed in enclosed places, she reflected, swishing a mosquito away with her tail. There was a noise of hoofs on the stairs behind her, and she shifted, twisting to look back over her flank at the person who approached. Another centaur, dark-haired and dark-skinned, and naked but for a crown of white flowers on her long tresses, approached. Yakut smiled and patted the grassy knoll beside her. "Good morning, Gesselle, my sister. I'm glad you came."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Her sister gracefully knelt to rest beside her. The centaur queen kissed her cheek and wrapped her arm around her waist. "Where is little Herne today?" she asked affectionately.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Gesselle sighed. "Off with his uncles, running in the southern border patrol. I'm afraid for him, my sister - he's still only a foal."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Yakut nodded and stroked her sister's hair. "He's like his father. Ten years old, and already training with the longspear. He'll be a mighty warrior one day, my sister."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Perhaps," fretted Gesselle, "but he is my son. How could I bear to lose another?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Have peace, my sister," said Yakut softly. "I pray that you will not lose him. Yet it is good for him to run in the patrol. This is how we grow and become strong."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]She gazed down into the valley below. "Each one of us has a part to play. The vale-men plant and farm, and the city is supplied with meat and bread and milk. The hill-folk and the dwarfkin mine and quarry and log to supply us shelter from the elements and the attacks of enemies. The scholars serve in studying, and the prophets in telling us the will of God." She was silent for a moment, watching the sunlight sparkle on a convoy bringing marble up from one of the quarries to the city. They were bringing it to the Altar to the One that the Luonnotar were building. She had heavily supported the project, over the grumbles of some of the elders of Kilmorph.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"To live is to serve others," resumed the queen after a moment. "And, by the will of the One, the service of centaurs is heavier than that of some others. We have strong bodies, and the speed of the wind in our hearts. It is fit that we should serve by defending those weaker and slower. You know this, my sister. Herne knows it."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Gesselle shook her head, scattering white petals. "He knows only the joy of running and the delight of his strength. He does not yet think of service."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"His uncles will teach him. And, if the spirit of his father lives in him, he will listen."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Gesselle was silent. She looked down into the valley, but her eyes did not see the City of Refuge. She absently plucked at the flowers on the grass. At length, she whispered, "And I, my sister? What is my service?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Yakut squeezed her sister close to her. "Yours is the heaviest of all. Yours is to give your beloved instead of yourself. To wait for his return instead of going. To watch early and late. To pray for others and to forget your own needs. Many will remember Herne and his strength, when he saves us in our hour of need, as we remember his father Nahar, and they will not know your name." The queen reached up and wiped a tear from Gesselle's cheek. "But I will remember, my sister. I will know. You are the mother of the Kuriotates. Your service is the most important of all."</English>

		<Italian>Era arrivata quando era ancora buio, per osservare e valutare, ma ora l'intera parte orientale del cielo era piena di nubi color salmone e di raggi di luce solare solida che sfioravano la vallata. Da dove era, sulla Vetta Verdeggiante, poteva vedere non solo la città, ma l'intera pianura, densa di praterie e cosparsa qua e là di foreste. Scendendo dai piedi delle montagne a nord vi era un grande fiume. Compiva grandi curve nella terra verdeggiante, mentre numerose fattorie, frutteti, vigneti e terreni di pascolo erano sparsi su entrambi i suoi lati. Alla fine del fiume vi era la città stessa, già brulicante di attività, che si estendeva su tutto il delta del fiume ed raggiungeva altezze incredibili: Kwythellar, la Citta Rifugio.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Yakut sedettè su punto panoramico della Vetta Verdeggiante e meditò. Veniva qui spesso; una o più volte al mese, per riflettere sul suo popolo e la sua città, per pianificare il loro futuro e per farsi un'idea delle sofferenze e dei trionfi dei Kuriotate. A volte si sentiva intrappolata nella vasta città, ma un giorno sulla Vetta gli schiariva la mente. Forse era la sua natura equina che gli creava disagio nei luoghi chiusi, riflettè, scacciando una zanzara con la coda. Vi era un rumore di zoccoli sulle scale alle sue spalle, lei si volto per vedere chi gli si stava avvicinando. Un'altra centaura, scura di capelli e di pelle, e nuda al di fuori di una corona di fiori bianchi sulle sue lunghe trecce si stava avvicinando. Yakut sorrise e accarezzò la collinetta erbosa vicino a lei. "Buon giorno, Gesselle, sorella mia. Sono contenta che tu sia venuta."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Sua sorella si inginocchiò con grazia per stare accanto a lei. La regina centaura gli baciò la guancia e avvolse il suo braccio attorno al suo bacino. "Dove è il piccolo Herne oggi?" lei chiese in maniera affettuosa.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Gesselle sospirò. "Con i suoi zii, pattugliando il confine meridionale. Sono preoccupata per lui sorella mia, è ancora solo un puledro."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Yakut annuì e accarezzò i capelli di sua sorella. "È come suo padre. Ha solo dieci anni e si sta già addestrando con la lancia lunga. Sarà un potente guerriero un giorno sorella mia."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Forse," disse in modo agitato Gesselle, "ma lui è mio figlio. Come posso sopportare di perderne un'altro?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Stai calma sorella mia," disse Yakut dolcemente. "Io prego che tu non lo perda. È comunque una cosa positiva per lui partecipare al pattugliamento. È cosi che noi cresciamo e diventiamo forti."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Guardò giù nella vallata. "Ognuno di noi ha una parte da seguire. Gli uomini della valle coltivano la terra e cosi la città viene rifornita con cibo. Il popolo delle colline e i nani scavano ed estraggono risorse per proteggerci dagli elementi e dagli attacchi dei nemici. Gli studiosi servono per capire il mondo e i profeti per dirci il volere di Dio." Rimase in silenzio un momento, osservando la luce del sole illuminare un convoglio che stava portando del marmo da una cava alla città. Stava venendo portato all'Altare dell'Unico che i Luonnotar stavano costruendo. Aveva fortemente sostenuto il progetto, sopra le lamentele di alcuni degli anziani di Kilmorph.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Vivere è servire gli altri," riprese la regina dopo un momento. "E, per volontà dell'Unico, il servizio dei centauri è più pesante di quello di alcuni altri. Abbiamo corpi forti, e la velocità del vento nei nostri cuori. È giusto che serviamo difendendo coloro più deboli e lenti. Tu sai questo sorella mia. Herne lo sa."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Gesselle scosse la testa, spargendo petali bianchi. "Lui conosce solo la gioia di correre e della sua forza. Non pensa ancora al servizio."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"I suoi zii glielo insegneranno. E, se lo spirito del padre vive in lui, ascolterà."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Gesselle era silenziosa. Lei guardava giù nella vallata, ma i suoi occhi non vedevano la Citta Rifugio. Osservava distrattamente i fiori sui prati. Alla fine, sussurrò, "E io, sorella mia? Qual è il mio servizio?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Yakut strinse sua sorella vicino a lei. "Il tuo è il più pesante di tutti. Quello di dare coloro che ami invece di te stessa. Di attendere il loro ritorno invece di partire. Di guardare presto e tardi. Di pregare per gli altri e di dimenticare i tuoi stessi bisogni. In molti si ricorderanno di Herne e della sua forza, quando ci salverà nella nostra ora del bisogno, come noi ricordiamo suo padre Nahar, senza conoscere il tuo nome." La regina asciugò una lacrima dalla guancia di Gesselle. "Ma io lo ricorderò sorella mia. Io lo saprò. Tu sei la madre dei Kuriotate. Il tuo servizio è il più importante di tutti."</Italian>
		<Spanish>She had arrived while it was still dark, to watch and to consider, but now the whole eastern sky was splashed with salmon-colored clouds and beams of solid sunlight that stroked the valley floor. From here on Verdant Peak, she could see not just the city, but the whole plain, thick with waving grasslands and sprinkled here and there with forests. Springing down from the foothills of the mountains to the north was a great river. It twisted in wide loops across the green earth, while garlands of farms, orchards, vineyards, and pasturelands spread out on either side of it. At the mouth of the river the city itself, already bustling with activity, sprawled across the delta and rose to gleaming heights: Kwythellar, the City of Refuge.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Yakut sat on the watch-seat of Verdant Peak and pondered. She came here often; once a month or more, to consider her people and her city, to plan their future, and to gain perspective on the sufferings and triumphs of the Kuriotates. She sometimes felt trapped within the vast city, but a day at the peak would clear her mind. Perhaps it was her equine nature that chafed in enclosed places, she reflected, swishing a mosquito away with her tail. There was a noise of hoofs on the stairs behind her, and she shifted, twisting to look back over her flank at the person who approached. Another centaur, dark-haired and dark-skinned, and naked but for a crown of white flowers on her long tresses, approached. Yakut smiled and patted the grassy knoll beside her. "Good morning, Gesselle, my sister. I'm glad you came."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Her sister gracefully knelt to rest beside her. The centaur queen kissed her cheek and wrapped her arm around her waist. "Where is little Herne today?" she asked affectionately.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Gesselle sighed. "Off with his uncles, running in the southern border patrol. I'm afraid for him, my sister - he's still only a foal."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Yakut nodded and stroked her sister's hair. "He's like his father. Ten years old, and already training with the longspear. He'll be a mighty warrior one day, my sister."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Perhaps," fretted Gesselle, "but he is my son. How could I bear to lose another?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Have peace, my sister," said Yakut softly. "I pray that you will not lose him. Yet it is good for him to run in the patrol. This is how we grow and become strong."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]She gazed down into the valley below. "Each one of us has a part to play. The vale-men plant and farm, and the city is supplied with meat and bread and milk. The hill-folk and the dwarfkin mine and quarry and log to supply us shelter from the elements and the attacks of enemies. The scholars serve in studying, and the prophets in telling us the will of God." She was silent for a moment, watching the sunlight sparkle on a convoy bringing marble up from one of the quarries to the city. They were bringing it to the Altar to the One that the Luonnotar were building. She had heavily supported the project, over the grumbles of some of the elders of Kilmorph.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"To live is to serve others," resumed the queen after a moment. "And, by the will of the One, the service of centaurs is heavier than that of some others. We have strong bodies, and the speed of the wind in our hearts. It is fit that we should serve by defending those weaker and slower. You know this, my sister. Herne knows it."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Gesselle shook her head, scattering white petals. "He knows only the joy of running and the delight of his strength. He does not yet think of service."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"His uncles will teach him. And, if the spirit of his father lives in him, he will listen."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Gesselle was silent. She looked down into the valley, but her eyes did not see the City of Refuge. She absently plucked at the flowers on the grass. At length, she whispered, "And I, my sister? What is my service?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Yakut squeezed her sister close to her. "Yours is the heaviest of all. Yours is to give your beloved instead of yourself. To wait for his return instead of going. To watch early and late. To pray for others and to forget your own needs. Many will remember Herne and his strength, when he saves us in our hour of need, as we remember his father Nahar, and they will not know your name." The queen reached up and wiped a tear from Gesselle's cheek. "But I will remember, my sister. I will know. You are the mother of the Kuriotates. Your service is the most important of all."</Spanish>

		<German>Es erinnerte sich an seine glorreichen Tage, an Geschwindigkeit, Krallen, Säure, und den Schlag lederner Flügel. Doch vor allem erinnerte es sich an Feuer und Brand. Es hat keine Nase um zu riechen oder Haut um zu fühlen, aber die Sensation von Hitze und Rauch und Flammen war verblieben.[PARAGRAPH:1]Das Bewusstsein drehte sich. Die Götter hatten das Interesse an ihm und an seiner Art vor langer Zeit verloren, oder gestern. Morgen, vielleicht. Zeit und Raum hatten wenig Bedeutung an diesem Ort, es gab nur Gedanken. Bewusstsein. Existenz. Existenz war der passende Ausdruck. Cogito ergo existo.[PARAGRAPH:1]Das war der Ort, an den die Kriegsmaschinen der Götter kamen um zu... nicht sterben. Gelagert zu werden. Zu ruhen. Das Bewusstsein würde nicht ruhen. Es erinnerte sich daran, als es das Güldene war, die mächtigste Kreatur aller geschaffenen Kreaturen. Dann hatte des den Feind durch alle Sphären hindurch bekämpft. Mit Feuer, mit Säure. Der Feind war immer noch da, ein störender Rest, wie ein Juckreiz, ein stetiger Tropfen Wasser in dem verdunkelten Raum der Gedanken. Wie sollte es möglich sein, zu ruhen, ohne diesen geistigen Stich zu fühlen?[PARAGRAPH:1]Und so, während die anderen ruhten, verwendete das Bewusstsein all seine Zeit, diese wenigen kurzen Augenblicke, um ein Tor zurück in die Welt zu suchen, einen Weg, die unfertige Arbeit zu beenden. Schlussendlich, nach vielen Versuchen und Rückschlägen, waren die Gedanken frei, frei in eine fremde Welt zu entschlüpfen. Wie auch immer, eine physische Form müsste später noch kommen. Dafür würde es Hilfe benötigen. Rituale müssten vollzogen werden, und ein Portal geschaffen werden. Es müsste die Hilfe von einigen der verschiedenen plappernden, verwirrten, schwachen, aber zahlreichen intelligenten Wesen benützen, die zu den Herrschern über diesen Planet geworden waren, seitdem das Bewusstsein zur Ruhe gesetzt worden war.[PARAGRAPH:1]Viele der Jahre dieses Ortes suchte das Bewusstsein nach einem passenden Gastgeber und Verbündeten unter den gelegentlich auftauchenden Höhepunkten der Genialität in einem Meer aus gewöhnlichen und kraftlosen Gehirnen. Manche dieser Spitzen waren schwer und brütend gewesen, wie eine drohende Sturmwolke, manche scharf und kalt wie ein Florett. Manche waren wispernd und unfassbar wie Nebel gewesen, und manche wahren erleuchtet mit hellen und veränderlichen Farbelementen und Geräuschen, die einen wachsenden Wahnsinn anzeigten. Viel zu viele waren mit dem Wesen des Feindes infiziert gewesen.[PARAGRAPH:1]Keine waren perfekt gewesen, bis auf diese. Erfüllt von sowohl magischem als auch geistigem Potenzial, aber immer noch beeinflussbar. Als sich das Bewusstsein näherte, erkannte es die Quelle dieses Geistes: ein kleines Kind, das weinend in den Ruinen eines verbrannten Heimes lag.[PARAGRAPH:1]Ihre Gedanken würden verschmelzen, zu beiderseitigem Gewinn. Der eine würde ein langes Leben und Macht erlangen. Der andere, irgendwann einmal, bekäme... eine Gestalt.</German>
		<Italian>Si ricordava dei suoi giorni di gloria, ricordava la velocità, gli artigli, l'acido e il battere delle ali. Sopra ogni cosa si ricordava del fuoco. Non vi era alcun naso con cui sentire odori, nessuna pelle, ma la sensazione di calore e fumo e di fiamme era sempre presente.[PARAGRAPH:1]La coscienza si agitò. Gli dei avevano perso interesse in lui e i suoi simili molto tempo fa, o ieri. Domani forse. Il tempo e lo spazio fisico avevano poca importanza in questo luogo, vi era solo il pensiero. Coscienza. Esistenza. Esistenza era la parola. Cogito, ergo existo.[PARAGRAPH:1]Questo era il luogo in cui le macchine da guerra degli dei andavano per... no, non morire. Essere conservate. Riposare. La coscienza non riposava. Si ricordava di quando era il Dorato, la creatura più forte del creato. Poi aveva combattuto i nemici nei vari piani. Col fuoco, con l'acido. I nemici erano ancora li, distrurbando il riposo come un formicolio doloroso, una costante goccia d'acqua nella stanza buia della mente. Come poteva riposare con questa piaga mentale?[PARAGRAPH:1]E cosi, mentre gli altri riposavano, la coscienza aveva passato tutto questo tempo, questi brevi momenti, a cercare per un portale per il mondo, un modo per completare del lavoro lasciato a metà. Finalmente, dopo molte prove ed errori, la mente si era liberata girando in un mondo alieno. La forma fisica però sarebbe arrivata in seguito. Per quello aveva bisogno di aiuto. Rituali dovevano essere fatti, e un portale creato. Avrebbe dovuto ottenere l'aiuto di alcune di queste diverse, chiaccherose, confuse, deboli ma numerose creature intelligenti che erano diventate i signori di questo pianeta da quando la coscienza era stata messa a riposo.[PARAGRAPH:1]Per molti anni di questo luogo la coscienza cercò per un ospite e alleato adatto tra le occasionali creature brillanti in un mare di menti mondane e deboli. Alcune di queste erano pesanti e meditabonde, come nuvole scure di tempesta, altre affilate e fredde come uno stiletto. Alcune erano intangibili come la nebbia, e altre si erano accese in un mix di colori e rumori, a indicare una crescente pazzia. Fin troppe erano state corrotte dal nemico.[PARAGRAPH:1]Nessuna era stata perfetta prima di questa. Inondato di potenziale sia magico che cerebrale, ma ancora malleabile. Mentre la coscienza si avvicinava, la fonte di questo potere divenne chiara: un piccolo bambino piangeva tra le rovine di una fattoria bruciata.[PARAGRAPH:1]Le loro menti si sarebbero unite, a vantaggio reciproco. Una avrebbe ottenuto una lunga vita e potere. L'altra, eventualmente, avrebbe ottenuto... un corpo.</Italian>

		<English>The Kuriotate Centaur Charger has two advantages over the Chariot it replaces: it requires neither the horse resource, nor the expensive siege workshop building. Their use remains the same. They have good withdrawal and high attack, providing a decent way to soften up advanced enemy units, although their defense is low so consider sending them in with some of their Centaur Archer brethren for protection.</English>

		<German>Die kuriotatischen Zentauren-Schlachtrösser haben 2 Vorteile gegenüber den Streitwagen, die sie ersetzten: Sie benötigen keine Pferde, und zusätzlich ist keine Belagerungswerkstatt nötig, um sie zu rekrutieren. Aber ihr Nutzen bleibt der selbe. Sie besitzen eine hohe Rückzugswahrscheinlichkeit und gute Angriffsfähigkeiten, was einen guten Weg darstellt, gegnerische Veteranen zu schwächen. Da sie nur über schwache Verteidigungsfähigkeiten verfügen, sollte man darauf achten, ihnen als Geleitschutz einige zentaurische Bogenschützen mit zu senden.</German>
		<Italian>Il Centauro Guerriero dei Kuriotate ha due vantaggi rispetto alla Biga che va a rimpiazzare: non richiede ne la risorsa cavallo ne il costoso edificio Officina d'assedio. Il loro utilizzo è lo stesso. Ha una buona probabilità di ritirarsi e un attacco elevato, permettendogli di ammorbidire eventuali unità nemiche più forti, ma la sua forza in difesa è bassa perciò ricorda di mandare insieme a loro qualche Centauro Arciere per proteggerli.</Italian>
