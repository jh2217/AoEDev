		<English>Bison are born without their trademark hump and horns and live for approximately twenty years. They grow to maturity at two to three years, although males continue to grow until about their seventh year. Adult bulls express a high degree of dominance competitiveness during mating season. Male bison fight for females and these fights often result in injury or death. After the bison mate, the herd splits up into smaller herds. Calves are born nine months after mating. The mothers take care of and nurse their young for a year. Male bison grow to as much as to 11.5 feet (3.5m) long, and 6.5 feet (2m) tall at the shoulder and can weigh up to 2200lbs (998 kg).</English>
		<French>Les Bisons naissent sans leur bosse et leurs cornes reconnaissables, et vivent environ 20 ans. Ils atteignent l'âge adulte vers deux ou trois ans, même si les mâles continuent de grandir jusqu'à leur 7 ans. Les mâles expriment une forte tendance à la bagarre à la domination durant la saison des amours. Le Bison mâle se bat souvent pour les femelles et ces luttes se terminent souvent pour des blessures ou la mort. Après l'accouplement, le troupeau se sépare en troupeaux plus réduits. Les femelles vêlent 9 mois plus tard, et s'occupent et nourissent leurs petits pour un an. Les Bisons mâles peuvent atteindre 3,5 m de long et 2 m au garrot, et peuvent peser jusqu'à 1100 kg.</French>

Diventano adulti intorno ai 2-3 anni, nonostante ciò i maschi continuano a crescere sino al loro settimo anno. I bisonti maschi adulti diventano particolarmente competitivi per il dominio durante la stagione degli accoppiamenti. Spesso questi scontri per le femmini si concludono con ferite o addirittura la morte. Dopo che si accoppiano la mandira principale si divide in mandrie più piccole. I vitelli nascono 9 mesi dopo l'accoppiamento e le madri si prendono cura del piccolo per un anno intero. I bisonti maschi possono arrivare ad essere lunghi 3.5m e alti, alla spalla, 2m  e pesare sino ai 998 kg.</Italian>

		<English>Camels are even-toed ungulates within the genus Camelus. The dromedary, one-humped or Arabian camel has a single hump and is well known for its healthy low fat milk, and the Bactrian camel has two humps. They are native to the dry desert areas of western Asia, and central and east Asia, respectively.
		The term camel is also used more broadly to describe any of the six camellike creatures in the family Camelidae: the two true camels, and the four South American camelids, the llama, alpaca, guanaco, and vicuña.
		The average life expectancy of a camel is 40 to 50 years. A fully grown adult camel stands 1.85 m (6 ft 1 in) at the shoulder and 2.15 m (7 ft 1 in) at the hump. The hump rises about 30 inches (75 cm) out of its body. Camels can run up to 65 km/h (40 mph) in short bursts and sustain speeds of up to 40 km/h (25 mph).
		Fossil evidence indicates that the ancestors of modern camels evolved in North America during the Palaeogene period, and later spread to most parts of Asia. Humans first domesticated camels before 2000 BC. The dromedary and the Bactrian camel are both still used for milk, meat, and as beasts of burden—the dromedary in western Asia and in Africa north of the sub-Saharan savannahs, and the Bactrian camel further to the north and east in central Asia.</English>

Magic is a risky business! Too risky for a poor son of mine, I reckon. So I urge you to take up cowing instead. I’m a cower, and I have earned a great deal of money through the business. Haven’t you ever wondered why I have such a nice home for all the cows?[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Cowing’s a respectable business, unlike that ‘death magic’ stuff your learning. Why raise the dead when you can raise a cow? Cows don’t hurt you; cows don’t attempt to kill you like those skeletons do. And if you like the death part of death magic, then there’s plenty of that in cowing, too! You even get to eat the cows you kill – or sell them for a profit. Dead cows are just as good as live cows, I say.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]With cows you can do countless things, unlike death magic. With death magic all you can do raise the dead or summon some spirits or become a lich. With cows you can eat them, milk them, sell them live, sell them dead, sell their milk, you can even sell the sick ones to Balseraph noblemen to use as projectiles. Also, they warn you of coming storms. Does death magic do all those things? I think not.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I urge you, Adonijah, to drop out of school and become a cower.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Your loving father,[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Nikud</English>

You see, Drahm has an evil sense of humor. And he's a master of bending the fabric of reality itself. Last time I fell asleep in his class, I woke up, spent ten minutes wondering how I'd ended up in the girls' bathroom, and then several hours trying to explain myself when Tyr walked in.[PARAGRAPH:2][ITALICS]Adept Morin</English>

		<Italian>Per l'amor di Oghma, non addormentarti mai durante la lezione dell'Arcimago Drahm. Mai. In nessun caso. Dormi prima, svieni dopo, ma non durante la sua lezione. Vedi, Drahm ha un senso del humor crudele. E lui è un maestro a piegare la struttura della realtà stessa. L'ultima volta che mi sono addormentato durante la sua lezione mi sono svegliato passando 10 minuti cercando di capire come avevo fatto a finire nel bagno delle ragazze, per poi passare diverse ore cercando di spiegare il perché quando Tyr è entrata.[PARAGRAPH:2][ITALICS]Adepto Morin</Italian>

		<English>You can tell a lot about a mage by their preferred sphere. Take Korven there. Earth adept. Not too bright, but honest. He's hardworking and a bit stubborn.

It takes him twice as long to learn a spell, but when he gets the hang of it he'll do it twice as well. -Adept Morin</English>

By his silence, I knew he was awaiting the answer to an unasked question. This time, as usual, I didn't know what was expected of me. I looked around, searching. After a time, as he continued to gaze at me, I grew frustrated. I was about to speak, to ask for the riddle so I could begin to answer it, when suddenly I felt-nay, tasted the glorious stuff for the first time. The Ether. My eyes betrayed my ecstasy, and my master smirked knowingly. He arched his eyebrow. I answered, finally, with one word. "Power."</English>

		<German>Am letzten Tag meiner Ausbildung, gleichzeitig der erste Tag, an dem ich den Titel Adept tragen durfte, nahm mich mein Meister mit auf den Gipfel dieses Hügels. Er setzte sich nieder. Durch sein Schweigen wusste ich, dass er eine Antwort auf eine unausgesprochene Frage erwartete. Wie immer wusste ich nicht, was von mir erwartet wurde, also schaute ich mich suchend um. Nach einer Weile, während er mich fortwährend anstarrte, wurde ich ungeduldig. Ich öffnete meine Lippen, um nach der Aufgabe fragen, da spürte – nein kostete – ich es plötzlich zum ersten Mal. Den Äther. Mein Augen müssen meine Verzückung verraten haben, den mein Meister grinste vielsagend. Erwartungsvoll hob er seine Augenbrauen und ich antwortete mit einem einzigen Wort: "Macht".</German>

Dopo un pò, mentre continuava a fissarmi, diventavo sempre più frustrato. Stavo per parlare, per chiedere quale fosse l'indovinello cosi da poter rispondere, quando all'improvviso percepii per la prima volta la sensazione gloriosa dell'etere. I miei occhi tradirono la mia estasi, e il mio maestro sorrise compiaciuto. Lui arcuò le sopracciglia. Io risposi, finalmente, con una parola. "Potere."</Italian>

[ PARAGRAPH:2]One de los métodos temprano-descubiertos de cosechar la sal estaba evaporando el agua de mar bajo el sol, proceso muy aburrido y costoso, conduciendo a los precios altos elevados para este bueno importante. No ser&#237;a hasta el mediados de-diecinueveavo siglo - cuando la explotaci&#243;n minera de la sal fue practicada extensamente a través del mundo que esta materia lleg&#243; a ser mucho menos costosa, no m&#225;s de largo "digno de su peso en oro," mientras que fue descrita com&#250;nmente.</Spanish>

		<English>Shrimp are aquatic crustaceans classified in the infraorder Caridea, found widely around the world in both fresh and salt water. Adult shrimp are filter feeding benthic animals living close to the bottom. They can live in schools and can swim rapidly backwards. Shrimp are an important food source for larger animals from fish to whales. They have a high resistance to toxins in polluted areas, and may contribute to high toxin levels in their predators. Together with prawns, shrimp are widely caught and farmed for human consumption.</English>

		<German>Garnelen sind aquatische Krustentiere, die zur Ordnung der Caridea gehören. Man findet sie überall auf der Welt in Süß- und Salzwasser. Erwachsene Garnelen ernähren sich durch das Herausfiltern von Krill aus den Wasserschichten nah am Boden. Sie leben in Schulen und können sich sehr schnell rückwärts bewegen. Garnelen sind eine wichtige Nahrungsquelle für große Tiere wie Fische und Wale. Sie sind sehr widerstandsfähig gegenüber den Giften in verschmutzten Gegenden und können so zur Anreicherung der Toxine in ihren Fressfeinden führen. Zusammen mit Riesengarnelen werden Garnelen weltweit gefangen und für den menschlichen Verbrauch in Farmen gezüchtet.</German>
		<Italian>I gamberetti (caridea) sono crostacei acquatici, diffusi intorno al mondo sia in acqua salata che dolce. La maggior parte dei gamberetti sono onnivori, ma alcune specie si nutrono filtrando l'acqua. Possono vivere in branchi e nuotare rapidamente all'indietro. I gamberetti sono un'importante fonte di cibo per gli animali più grandi, dai pesci alle balene. Hanno un'elevata resistenza alle tossine delle aree inquinate pertanto possono contribuire agli alti tassi di tossine presenti nei loro predatori. Insieme ai gamberi comuni, i gamberetti sono ampiamente pescati e allevati per il consumo umano.</Italian>
